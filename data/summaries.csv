0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,case658.txt,"Murakami's father, Noboru Arthur Murakami, was a United States citizen born and raised in Los Angeles and nearby Terminal Island, California. He and his family were relocated by the Government to the Manzanar internment camp in the desert near Bishop, California pursuant to Executive Order 9066. Because the Court of Federal Claims correctly determined that Murkami was not entitled to compensation under the Act, we affirm. Arthur Murakami married Aiko Tani, who was also from Los Angeles.Around July 1944, the Government permitted Arthur Murkami to move to Chicago, but prohibited him from returning to the West Coast.Around February 10, 1945, Arthur MurKami received an individual exclusion order prohibiting him personally from returning.In a letter dated July 21, 1945 from the U.S. Headquarters Western Defense Command, Arthur Murphy's exclusion order was lifted.Murakami was born in Chicago approximately one month later, on August 23, 1945. His family moved from Chicago to Los Angeles approximately ten years later. Murakami and the Government filed motions for judgment on the administrative record. Court of Federal Claims granted the Government's motion but remanded the case to the Redress Office. Justice Department reconsidered Murakami's claim and concluded that he was still not entitled to a redress payment. 50 U.S.C.app.§ 1989b-4(h)(1) (2004).Evidentiary determinations by the Court of Federal Claims, including motions to supplement the administrative record, are reviewed for abuse of discretion. Air Land Forwarders, Inc. v. United States, 172 F.3d 1338, 1341 (Fed.Cir.1999). The Act was passed on March 21, 1942. The Justice Department promulgated regulations to implement the Act. The Act then defined eligible individuals: Any individual of Japanese ancestry who, during the evacuation, relocation, and internment period, was a United States citizen or a permanent resident alien. After January 20, 1945, individuals were generally free under the law to decide for themselves whether and when they should return to the West Coast. This is the basis for eligibility under Ishida, and the Department is bound by the court's strictures. An individual is found to be eligible if such an individual:Is of Japanese ancestry;  and was living on the date of enactment of the Act, August 10, 1988. Murakami argues that he is an eligible individual “otherwise deprived of liberty” under 50 U.S.C.app.§ 1989b-7. Murakami alleges that his situation is analogous to the appellant in Ishida v. United States, 59 F.3d 1224 (Fed.Cir.1995), because he was excluded from his parents' home of Los Angeles. Higashi was born on February 6, 1945, seventeen days after the Government's rescission of Executive Order 9066 became effective.Higashi argued that her family was constructively or actively restrained by governmental action after January 20, 1945. The court held that children born to parents of Japanese ancestry who were excluded from their family homes in prohibited military zones are entitled to compensation. In Ishida, this court interpreted the Act to extend compensation to newborns excluded by law from their parents original place of residence as a result of Executive Order 9066.Because all restrictions on travel and relocation were rescinded as of January 20, 1945 by Proclamation No.21, from that date forward newborns or other family members were no longer “excluded by law” from returning to their original residences. Murakami III, 52 Fed.Cl.at 236. Court of Federal Claims concluded that the Redress Office's approach appeared inconsistent with the plain language of 50 U.S.C.app.§ 1989b-7 that an individual is eligible for redress if deprived of liberty “as a result of” governmental laws or orders.Accordingly, the court remanded Murakami's claim to the Justice Department for a redetermination. Murakami was born several months after Executive Order 9066 was rescinded and more than one month after Arthur Murakami's individual exclusion order was lifted. According to the Justice Department, children born after the rescission are not eligible for redress payments. The Justice Department concluded that the Murkami family's decision not to return to the West Coast was solely a “personal decision” based on the family's lack of housing. The Act provides that U.S. citizens and permanent resident aliens are eligible for redress if they were “confined, held in custody, relocated, or otherwise deprived of liberty or property as a result of” certain enumerated governmental actions. According to dictionary definitions, the verb “result” commonly means “to proceed, spring, or arise as a consequence, effect, or conclusion” This language is naturally read simply to impose the requirement of a causal connection between the “injury” or “aggravation of an injury” and “hospitalization, medical or surgical treatment, or the pursuit of a course of vocational rehabilitation.” Brown v. Gardner, 513 U.S. 115, 119, 115 S.Ct.552, 130 L.Ed.2d 462 (1994). Other circuit courts of appeal have reached similar conclusions. The court also rejected Murakami's allegations that, even if not medically impractical, it was impossible for the family to wrap up their affairs in Chicago, find emp.at 351 n. 3. The court further concluded that Murkami's medical evidence, presented in a one-page declaration submitted by Aiko MurakAMI's doctor, Dr. Shigekawa, was conclusory in its hypothetical recommendation that she should not have traveled.",,
1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,case163.txt,"Brian Petty appealed the district court's summary judgment and judgment on partial findings in favor of Metropolitan Government of Nashville-Davidson County. Petty claims that Metro violated his rights under the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act of 1994 (“USERRA”) The central dispute in this case is whether Metro violated USERRA in its treatment of Petty. Plaintiff's unit ran the camp on a day-to-day basis-moving supplies; setting out bottled water for soldiers;  handling any problems with housing, etc.The job also required Plaintiff to empty and store contraband from “amnesty boxes.” In June or July, 2004, Command Sergeant Thomas Seuberling conducted a health and welfare inspection of Plaintiff's quarters. During the initial inspection, CSM.Seuberling found a five-gallon jerry can that Plaintiff was using to manufacture homemade wine. Plaintiff's discharge was characterized as “under honorable conditions (general).”   The Army returned Plaintiff to Fort Stewart, Georgia on or about February 1, 2005. The Police Department's return-to-work process includes a personal history update questionnaire, a medical examination, a computer voice stress analysis, a drug screening, and a debriefing with a police psychologist. Lieutenant Howey prepared a report concluding that the allegation that Plaintiff was not truthful when he completed return-to-work paperwork was unfounded. Lieutenant Howey signed this report on May 17, 2005. Chief of Police Ronal Serpas accepted Mr. Howey's conclusions. On July 22, 2005, Ms. Sawyers sent Plaintiff a letter stating that OPA had completed its investigation and determined that the charges against him were unfounded. Petty v. Metro.Gov't of Nashville-Davidson, No.3:05-0680, 2006 WL 3333509 at *1-5, 2006 U.S. Dist.LEXIS 83787 at *2-16 (M.D.Tenn.Nov. 16, 2006) (internal citations omitted;  footnotes in original).Petty's complaint alleged that Metro violated his rights under USERRA. The nonmoving party must present sufficient evidence to create a genuine issue of material fact. A different standard is applied to the entry of a judgment on partial findings. The district court is not required to draw any special inferences, and it is permitted to weigh the evidence and resolve any conflicts therein. On appeal, we review legal determinations de novo and the relevant findings of fact for clear error.Sharp ex rel.Estate of Sharp v. United States, 401 F.3d 440, 443 (6th Cir.2005).III.STRUCTURE OF USERRA. Fourth, it prevents employers from firing without cause any returning veterans within one year of reemployment. At times, the interplay among these provisions has caused some confusion. We find that Petty is entitled to summary judgment with respect to his first two claims; the third, which we will analyze separately, is not properly asserted as a reemployment claim. Petty provided a form DD-214, which Metro concedes he provided. Metro argues that Petty's form did not include three fields at the bottom of the form. We conclude that it would be inconsistent with the goals of USERRA to prevent Petty from exercising his right to reemployment because he failed to provide forthrightly information. Petty's separation from military service is classified as “under honorable conditions,” which Congress has made clear suffices to qualify him for USERRA benefits. The district court determined that Metro's return-to-work procedures could be applied to Petty, finding that because they are applicable to all individuals regardless of military service, these procedures did not constitute “additional prerequisites.” The district court incorrectly characterized part of Petty's reemployment claim-that part dealing with the position to which he was reinstated- as being part of his discrimination claims and therefore held that it required a showing of discrimination. The Department of Labor specified that “[t]he employee is not required to prove that the employer discriminated against him or her because of the employee's uniformed service in order to be eligible for reemployment” Petty's alleged ""dishonesty"" cannot serve as a basis for delaying or otherwise limiting Petty's right to reemployment. Metro's attempt to impose additional prerequisites through its return-to-work process was, as we have already explained, wholly impermissible. “Prompt reemployment” means reemployment as soon as practicable under the circumstances. Metro has never proved Petty's disqualification for reemployment. The burden of proving that a returning veteran is not qualified falls on the employer, not on the employee. Section 4312 protects only a service person's right to reemployment, which in turn triggers § 4313's guarantee of the appropriate position of employment. Petty argues that claims for failure to rehire promptly and denial of his request to perform off-duty work constitute violations of USERRA's antidiscrimination provision. The district court erred in its legal analysis of this claim, and because it clearly erred. in its finding that no evidence in the record supported this claim. We reverse its judgment on partial findings. Metro argues that Petty was denied permission to engage in off-duty employment because he was being investigated at the time of his request. Metro argues that this second investigation, although indirectly involving his military service, is solely motivated by concerns for Petty's honesty and truthfulness. The district court concluded that “[t]he only evidence before the Court that [Petty]'s military status was a motivating factor in [Metro]'s decision is the opinion of [Pety] himself” This email establishes: (1) that after the first investigation was complete, there was still concern regarding Petty's conduct in service, not his honesty, amongst those who initiated the second investigation. (2) that the informal investigation that led to the second, formal investigation was quite possibly motivated by those concerns about Petty's military service.Indeed, Sawyers' testimony appears to confirm this latter point.",,
2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,case156.txt,"Jaimi L. Bowers worked at the Youngstown Air Reserve Station as a Logistics Support Specialist in the Logistics Readiness Squadron, 910th Maintenance Support Group. She was terminated from her position on August 15, 2005. She contends that she was wrongfully charged with being absent without leave and discharged on the basis of her gender, her disabilities, and in retaliation for filing a complaint. On March 31, 2009, the district court granted the Secretary's motion to dismiss Bowers' complaint. Bowers now appeals the dismissal of her complaint.Standard of Review: The parties and the court construed the Secretary’s motion as an attack on the factual basis for subject matter jurisdiction. In United States v. Johnson, the Supreme Court invoked the military discipline rationale underlying the Feres doctrine in a case involving negligence on the part of civilian employees of the government. The Court determined that the “unique disciplinary structure of the military establishment and Congress' activity in the field” constituted “special factors” making it inappropriate to allow a judicially-created remedy. The plaintiff's husband, a member of the Coast Guard, was killed when his helicopter crashed during a rescue mission. The plaintiff alleged that the crash resulted from the negligent actions of civilian radar controllers. The Court held that the plaintiff could not pursue her FTCA claim, in part, because:[M]ilitary discipline involves not only obedience to orders, but more generally duty and loyalty to one's service and to one’s country. This Court extended the analysis in Feres and Chappell to discrimination claims brought by military personnel pursuant to Title VII and the Rehabilitation Act in Coffman v. Michigan. The Court declined to limit Feres to claims by officers against their superiors because even an inquiry into whether a suit questions “military discipline and decisionmaking would itself require judicial inquiry into, and hence intrusion upon, military matters” This Court has reiterated the holding from Leistiko on several occasions. In Fisher v. Peters, the Court considered a Title VII claim by a National Guard technician who alleged that her supervisors had downgraded her performance appraisal and denied her requests for promotion. The Court affirmed a grant of summary judgment in favor of the defendant because the position is irreducibly military in nature. In the Fifth Circuit, only claims “arising purely” from the employee's civilian status may be brought. In the Ninth Circuit, dual status technicians are barred from bringing claims where “the challenged conduct is integrally related to the military's unique structure” The ART and National Guard technician positions are both subject to 10 U.S.C.§ 10216(a)(1), which provides:For purposes of this section and any other provision of law, a military technician (dual status) is a Federal civilian employee. The functions performed by ARTs and National Guard technicians, as described in the applicable statutes, are substantially the same. The “distinctively military tasks” noted by Wright in the National Guard Technicians Act are duplicated in 10 U.S.C.§ 10216(a)(1)(C) ARTs train reservists, provide continuity within the Reserve unit of assignment, and support the unit's gaining major command. The ART workforce provides stable, continuous full-time management, administration, and training of the Ready Reserve. ARTs oversee the transition from peacetime to a wartime or national emergency situation to ensure mobilization readiness. Bowers argues that the district court should have considered that ARTs are not required to wear uniforms while performing their civilian duties. Bowers cites McGinnis v. United States Air Force, 266 F.Supp.2d 748 (S.D.Ohio 2003), as evidence that there is nothing intrinsically military about the Logistics Management Specialist position. Bowers contends on appeal that Majors Sturdevant and Coburn did not supervise her in her military capacity. The Federal Circuit's analysis in Bowers v. United States, 450 F.3d 1342, 1342 (Fed.Circuit) found that the position of National Guard technician, as a whole, is irreducibly military in nature. Jentoft, 450 F.3d at 1343. The court reasoned that “there is no language in § 10216(a) limiting the circumstances in which a dual status technician can be considered a federal civilian employee” The Fifth Circuit has rejected the holding in Jentoft as applied to National Guard technicians and ARTs. In its previous cases, the Court acknowledged, along with every other circuit that has considered claims by dual status technicians, that National Guard technicians occupy a position with a civilian component. Bowers urges the Court to adopt the three-factor “incident to service” test used in Parker v. United States, 611 F.2d 1007 (5th Cir.1980), to determine whether an injured service member was barred from bringing an FTCA claim. Under Feres v. United States, 340 U.S. 135, 71 S.Ct.153, 95 L.Ed.152 (1950), and its corollaries, no cause of action exists for Bowers' allegations. Dismissal is appropriate for failure to state a claim, a result distinct from holding that the court lacks subject-matter jurisdiction.",,
3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,case274.txt,"Lance Corporal Aaron Schoenfeld lost his leg while a passenger in his roommate's car when it crashed into a previously damaged, but unrepaired, guardrail on a military base.The sole issue on appeal is whether the Feres doctrine, which immunizes the government from suit for injuries arising incident to military service, bars Schoenfield's claim against the government under the Federal Tort Claims Act. After the accident, Schoenfeld continued to receive his regular military salary until 2002, when he was placed on the Navy's Temporary Disability Retirement List. He is entitled to affordable healthcare and pharmacy services through the military's TRICARE program. He claims that he has not been reimbursed for several surgeries and that he was forced to purchase his own medical insurance. The government moved to dismiss the complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. The FTCA is a broad waiver of the federal government's sovereign immunity. In Feres, the Supreme Court carved out a significant exception. “The Government is not liable under the [FTCA] for injuries to servicemen where the injuries arise out of or are in the course of activity incident to service.’ ” Costo, 248 F.3d at 866. In Johnson, an active duty Air Force sergeant moonlighted as a bartender in the Noncommissioned Officers Club (“NCO Club”) located on Malmstrom Air Force base in Montana. One night, Johnson and several other employees held a liquor-laden after-hours party until 4:30 a.m. Another employee, intoxicated, agreed to drive Johnson to his off-base home. About a mile outside the entrance to the base, Hay's vehicle was involved in an accident which resulted in Johnson becoming a quadriplegic. The government denied Johnson's administrative claim. He brought suit under the FTCA alleging that the government negligently allowed the NCO Club to stay open late in violation of Montana and military law. We held that Feres was inapplicable, noting that “the most persuasive [policy] justification for the Feres doctrine is the potential impact of civil suits on military discipline” Johnson thus strongly suggests that NCO Club positions were not actually available to civilians, but rather that the essentially non-military nature of the activity weighed against applying Feres. Johnson's activities could not have adversely affected military discipline for three reasons. He was “not subject in any real way to the compulsion of military orders or performing any sort of military mission” Dreier's widow sued under the FTCA, alleging the government knew that the area was hazardous but did nothing to make it more safe. We reversed the district court's ruling that Feres barred her suit. We reasoned that because civilians could gain access to the beach, Dreier's presence there made his activities “indistinguishable” from a civilian. In Bon, Janice Bon was an active duty member of the United States Navy.She was injured when a government motor boat struck a canoe she was rowing and had rented from the Navy's Special Services facility at the San Diego Naval Training Center.Bon was on authorized liberty at the time, though it is unclear for how long. Nollie Costo, a sailor in the United States Navy, drowned during a Navy-sponsored recreational white water rafting trip. While the actual rafting was off-base, the trip was part of the Navy's Morale, Welfare, and Recreation program, the “administration, supervision, and operation” of which was the ‘responsibility of cognizant commanding officers’ Coffey, 455 F.2d at 1380. Schoenfeld, an active duty marine, was on liberty from Friday afternoon until Monday morning. The district court assumed for purposes of the motion that the car in which Coffey rode was heading off-base for non-military purposes. Schoenfeld received substantial disability benefits from the military, a fact that weighs in favor of applying Feres. But riding along Stuart Mesa Road, which is partially open to the public, was not a privilege available to him because of his military status. A serviceman is not precluded from FTCA recovery merely because he receives disability benefits. In Millang, plaintiff's suit was Feres-barred in part because the picnic where the accident occurred was open only to servicemen and their guests. In Bon, we emphasized that Janice Bon was able to rent a canoe only because of her military status. In Dreier, the beach was open to civilians (with a permit) as well as servicemen. This case is unlike Bon, Costo, or McConnell, where the plaintiffs' military status afforded them access to certain privileges. Civilians and servicemen alike could drive on Stuart Mesa Road. Schoenfeld's activities leading up to his accident are not meaningfully distinguishable from those of a civilian.",,
4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,case161.txt,"Wayne G. Lovely, a former student at the University of Dayton (“UD”) and member of the Army Reserve Officers' Training Corps (‘ROTC’), brought claims against the United States of America and its agency. Lovely's claims were based on actions taken by Lovely's ROTC commander in relation to a UD disciplinary proceeding initiated against Lovely. The district court dismissed Lovely's IIED claim under the Feres doctrine. In January 2004, a female cadet reported to Washington that Lovely had sexually assaulted her in September 2003.She declined to press criminal charges, but accepted Washington's recommendation that she see a counselor at UD's counseling center.Upon the advice of Dr. Carol Cummins-Collier at the counseling center, the female Cadet decided to pursue proceedings against Lovely through the UD disciplinary board.A UD disciplinary-board hearing was scheduled for February 17, 2004.Lovely was suspended on March 8, 2005. Lovely was disenrolled from ROTC for misconduct, preventing any eligibility to re-enroll.Lovely filed a claim for damages with the Army, which was denied, primarily on the basis that Feres precluded Lovely, who was enlisted in the Army at the time of the alleged injury, from recovering for an injury incident to service. Congress created a waiver of sovereign immunity under which the United States may be held liable for “tort claims, in the same manner and to the same extent as a private individual under like circumstances.” The language of the FTCA exempts from this waiver of immunity claims “arising out of the combatant activities of the military or naval forces, or the Coast Guard, during time of war. Lovely argues that his claims are not subject to the Feres doctrine because he was not on active duty or subject to military command or discipline while attending classes at UD or while involved in the UD disciplinary proceedings. The Eighth and the Second Circuits have done so, concluding that the doctrine applied when the ROTC cadet's injuries occurred in the course of activity incident to military service. We conclude, however, that application of the Feres doctrine to Lovely's claim is supported by the third rationale stated in Johnson. Because Lovely's injuries stemmed from the manner in which his commanding officer chos.at 15, we conclude that the case should be dismissed.",,
5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,case112.txt,"Appellants filed a class action complaint against the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) on behalf of themselves and a putative class of veterans. The complaint alleged that the VA violated 11.C.A.§ 525 (West 2004 & Supp.2006), the anti-discrimination provision of the Bankruptcy Code. The district court granted the VA's motion to dismiss. The VA refused to extend full guaranty amounts to Appellants because it had suffered losses on previous loan guaranties made on their behalf that had not been repaid. The amount of guaranty available to a veteran upon a successive application for the benefit is reduced by the amount of loss that the VA suffered on any previous guaranty made on behalf of the veteran. 11 U.S.C.A.§ 1291 (West 2006).II. We review de novo the district court's grant of the VA's motion to dismiss made pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6).Bominflot, Inc. v. The M/V Henrich S, 465 F.3d 144, 145 (4th Cir.2006). a veteran satisfying the length of service requirements is entitled to the loan guaranty benefit. Section 525(a)'s meaning is plain. The statute clearly specifies that its protections extend to “licenses, permits, charters, [and] franchises,” and to grants “similar” to those items. Although the term “grant” is not defined in the statute, the use of the word ‘similar’ limits the universe of ‘grants’ to which § 525(a) applies. Governmental entities issue real-estate, driver's, and medical licenses;  building and business permits; and corporate charters. All of these implicate “government's role as a gatekeeper in determining who may pursue certain livelihoods,” Toth v. Mich. State Hous.Dev.Auth., 136 F.3d 477, 480 (6th Cir.1998), and show that Congress intended the protections to be “limited to situations sufficiently similar to Perez” Appellants acknowledge that Goldrich's rationale is plainly at odds with their position on appeal, but they argue that Congress's enactment in 1994 of 11 U.S.C.A. rendered Goldrich a dead letter. Congress's tightly-worded abrogation of Goldrich’s specific holding “justif[ies] the inference that items not mentioned” were excluded by deliberate choice, not inadvertence. Appellants assume that the VA has deep pockets;  we assume that those pockets only function well when they do not have holes in them. The basic entitlement for any loan of more than $56,520 is the lesser of $36,000 or forty percent of the loan. The VA does retain some discretion in computing the aggregate amount of guaranty available. Omitting the word “similar,” Section 525(a) would present a “textbook ejusdem generis scenario.”  Andrews v. United States, 441 F.3d 220, 224 (4th Cir.2006) A veteran is only automatically eligible for a guaranty when a private lender concludes that the veteran meets the standards of creditworthiness-including debt-to-income ratio, income-stability, and monthly-income requirements-established by the VA.

6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,case370.txt,"Appellant Martin Gillan, IV was discharged from the United States Naval Reserve because he was twice passed over for promotion while classified as an active reservist.Gillan has challenged his discharge on the ground that the Navy should not even have considered him for a promotion and only did so because it had improperly failed to transfer him to an inactive status. Gillan was commissioned as a Coast Guard officer in 1978 and served on active duty as an aviator until he was honorably discharged in 1985 at the rank of Lieutenant. Gillan should have been considered for promotion turns on whether he was properly classified in an active status in the Ready Reserve or in an inactive status. Martin Gillan served in the Coast Guard Individual Ready Reserve from May 1985 until October 1987.Gillan then transferred to the Naval Reserve in late 1987 as a member of the Ready Reserve and was promoted to Lieutenant Commander in 1990.In December 1990, Gillan was activated for service in Operation Desert Storm.After hostilities ceased and effective May 31, 1991, he transfer to the Individual Ready reserve in an active status.At the time of this transfer, the Navy told Gillan that, if he wanted a category of lesser participation, he could request a transfer to Standby Reserve Inactive. Gillan never responded to this invitation. Naval Reserve Line Commander Selection Boards reviewed Gillan's file in April 1994 and April 1995 but failed to promote him to Commander. In 1997, two years after his transfer to an inactive status, Gillan tried to renew his activity in the Naval Reserve by participating in training drills. After Gillan participated in drills for five months, the Navy notified him in March 1998 that he could no longer participate in reserve activities because a Lieutenant Commander who twice fails selection for Commander must be discharged after twenty years of commissioned service. Gillan was honorably discharged on August 1, 2001. On a number of occasions, Gillan sought to have the Navy make this change to his 1990 fitness report and to vacate its decisions not to promote him, which would allow his continued service.He first petitioned the Navy in 1998.The BCNR considered and then rejected this request on June 24, 1999.Two subsequent petitions for rehearing were denied in 2001 and 2002 because Gillan failed to present new or material evidence that had not been previously considered.Gillan finally sought reconsideration in 2003. Gillan argues that 10 U.S.C.§ 12642(b) requires that the Navy conduct an annual screening of all reservists followed by an immediate transfer to inactive status of those who failed to qualify for active status. In Gillan's view of the statute, the Navy should have transferred him from the Ready Reserves to an inactive status earlier than it did. We review de novo the district court's grant of summary judgment for the Navy. Gillan argues that the word “shall” limits the Secretary's discretion. But nowhere does the statute impose a time requirement for such a transfer. Gillan's argument conflates the requirements of an annual “screening,” called for by Navy and Department of Defense regulations.",,
7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,case256.txt,"Rigoberto Aguilar-Turcios is a native and citizen of Honduras.He was admitted to the United States as a lawful permanent resident in 1996.While in the Marine Corps, he used a government computer to access pornographic internet sites.In 2003, he pled guilty to and was convicted by special court-martial of violating Article 92 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice (“U.C.M.J.”) Aguilar was convicted of violating Article 92 by violating or failing to obey a “lawful general order.”  A violation of either of these subsections requires conduct involving a visual depiction of a minor engaging in sexually explicit conduct. Aguilar's Article 92 conviction is not a categorical aggravated felony. The majority relies on our statement in Navarro-Lopez v. Gonzales, 503 F.3d 1063 (9th Cir.2007) (en banc), that we can never apply the modified categorical approach. The majority holds that our current precedent compels us to permit Aguilar-Turcios to remain in the United States. The petition for review and remand to the BIA with instructions to terminate the proceedings and order the government to release Aguilar. I dissent from the majority's application of this statement to the facts of this case because Aguilar-Turcios certainly was convicted of a crime that contained all the necessary elements of 18 U.S.C.§ 2252(a)(2), (4) I write to question our reliance on Navarro-Lopez's broad claim that we may never look to the modified categorical approach where the statute is missing an element of the generic crime. An “aggravated felony” includes offenses described in 18 U.S.C.§ 1101(a)(43)(I) (listing crimes relating to child pornography) Aguilar-Turcios pled guilty to violations of two broad provisions of the UCMJ. We analyze the Article 92 conviction as the only basis for removal. The majority finds that the Article 92 conviction lacks an element required by 18 U.S.C.§ 2252, namely proof that the pornography accessed by Aguilar-Turcios contained “a visual depiction of a minor engaging in sexually explicit conduct.” The majority, however, concludes that it cannot apply the modified categorical analysis because “the crime of conviction lacking an element of the generic crime” Chief Judge Kozinski's approach in Li is subject to criticism on a variety of fronts. It goes well beyond anything that the Supreme Court required in Shepard and Taylor. It is entirely inconsistent with almost two decades of Ninth Circuit precedent. It has created a jurisprudence of false-starts, conflicting decisions, and confusion. The approach in Li's concurrence is not so flexible. If a conviction is missing an element of the generic crime, a court can never look beyond the terms of the statute. This approach completely removes certain crimes from consideration in the immigration context. The result is that Navarro-Lopez makes an alien removable based more on geography than the conviction. There is no need to retry the facts of the conviction here because the plea colloquy, charging document, and stipulations of fact are undisputed in the record before us. A more flexible analysis is all the more appropriate in the present case because the reasons for adopting a strict reading of the Taylor categorical and modified categorical analysis are not implicated in civil removal proceedings. There is no doubt that Aguilar-Turcios is an alien, that he knowingly possessed images depicting a minor engaging in sexually explicit conduct, and that he was convicted under the UCMJ for that crime. Finding otherwise requires a significant indulgence of the “legal imagination.” The rule announced in Navarro-Lopez also conflicts with almost twenty years of Ninth Circuit jurisprudence. At least twenty-four published decisions from 1990 to 2009 have applied the modified categorical approach. Carrillo-Jaime v. Holder, 572 F.3d 747 (9th Cir.2009) (applying the modified categorical approach even though the California fraud statute does not require a showing that property was taken “without consent,” the second element of the generic “theft offense” described at 8 U.S.C.§ 1101(a)(43)(G));  Salazar-Luviano v. Mukasey, 551 F. 3d 857, 862-63 (9st Cir.2008) (Applying themodified categorical. approach to California's burglary statute, Aguilar-Turcios pled guilty to using a government computer to access pornographic websites. Nijhawan specifically holds that the loss requirement is not an element and that the framework from Taylor and Shepard does not apply to this portion of 8.S.C.§ 1101(a)(43)(M)(i) The only pornography that Aguilar-Turcios admitted to accessing on his government computer during the plea colloquy were the six images of child pornography. The military judge presiding over the plea proceedings carefully walked through all of the elements of what would be, in the civilian world, a conviction under 18 U.S.C.§ 2252. Aguilar also pled guilty to and was convicted by special court-martial of violating Article 134 of the U.S.C.M.J. He used two different computer hard drives, including the hard drive of the computer used in connection with his Article 92 conviction, to wrongfully and knowingly possess visual depictions of minors engaging in sexually explicit conduct. Navarro-Lopez has created a dramatic turnabout on this issue in our circuit. The UCMJ is thus best viewed as a parallel system of law enforcement, akin to a state criminal system. To conclude otherwise would be to render the immigration removal laws inapplicable. Some of the decisions cited in this Part, have been overruled or abrogated by the Court's recent decision in Nijhawan v. Holder. The statement in Navarro-Lopez conflicts with the approach taken by our precedent and sister circuits. See infra Part III.D.",,
8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,case377.txt,"Aguayo volunteered to serve in the U.S. Army in November 2002, when he was 30 years old. Aguayo committed to eight years in the Army, with four years of active duty, and entered service as a healthcare specialist in January 2003. In February 2004, shortly before he was deployed to Iraq, he applied for a discharge from the Army on the basis of conscientious objection. The Army denied his application, and he filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in the district court. The court denied the petition, and Agayo now appeals. Aguayo's application was denied by the Department of the Army Conscientious Objector Review Board (“DACORB” or “Board”) in July 2004. In August 2005 Aguayo petitioned the United States District Court for the District of Columbia for a writ of habeas corpus ordering the Army to discharge him as a conscientious objector. The parties agreed to stay the proceedings in light of Aguaye's assertion that the Army had violated its own regulations by failing to provide him with the opportunity to rebut the negative recommendations from the officers in his chain of command. After exhausting all procedures for administrative relief, service members may challenge their custody by petitioning for a writ of habeas corpus in federal court. Aguayo's first argument concerns the DACORB's March 2006 supplemental memorandum, which lists several reasons for the Board's denial of Aguayo's application. Aguayo argues that, Habeas Rule 7 notwithstanding, courts may not consider new evidence in reviewing a conscientious objector habeas petition. We agree that the Army's decision to reject Aguayo's CO application must be supported by evidence in the administrative record. But the supplemental memorandum does not purport to contain such evidence. “Basis in fact” review in conscientious objector cases traces to the Supreme Court's 1946 decision in Estep v. United States, 327 U.S. 114, 66 S.Ct.423, 90 L.Ed.567. Estep was prosecuted for failing to submit to induction, and the Court held that he could challenge his military service classification. The Army defines conscientious objection as “[a] firm, fixed and sincere objection to participation in war in any form or the bearing of arms, because of religious training and belief.” The Supreme Court has stated that “the ultimate question in conscientious objector cases is the sincerity of the registrant” The review process relies heavily on the considered opinions of a number of officers. In this case, the DACORB ruled that Aguayo “did not present clear and convincing evidence ․ that the applicant's stated beliefs warrant award of 1-O sta.",,
9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,case242.txt,"Chi Tong Kuok was convicted after a jury trial on four counts of conspiracy and attempt to export defense articles. Kuok is a citizen of Macau, a special administrative region of the People's Republic of China. For roughly a decade, Kuok engaged in efforts to import protected defense articles from the United States into China. Kuok started his own business in 2000, installing and maintaining building management systems. A few years before he opened this business, Kuok developed contacts with a businessman who identified himself as a Chinese cultural official. Zheng began asking Kuok to buy items from abroad that could not be obtained in China. Kuok generally had no problems acquiring them, but troublingly, it would often take a long time for Zheng to pay Kuok back. Zheng refused to let him out of the deal, instead telling Kuok that he had no choice.In 2007, Kuok was diagnosed with a tumor and hospitalized for a week, again begging to be let out of Zheng's schemes, but still Zheng refused. Kuok made a Brady request for any materials in the government's possession that would support his duress defense. The government objected to the Brady request, and the district court denied it as untimely. Kuok argues that the Arms Export Control Act invalidly delegates legislative authority. The Constitution provides that “[a]ll legislative Powers herein granted shall be vested in a Congress of the United States” The Supreme Court has announced a nondelegation principle: “Congress may not constitutionally delegate its legislative power to another branch of Government” The AECA authorizes the President to maintain the United States Munitions List. The Supreme Court rejected a similar nondelegation challenge in United States v. Curtiss–Wright Exp.Corp., 299 U.S. 304 (1936) The AECA does not violate the constitutional prohibition on delegation of legislative power. Kuok challenges his conviction on the grounds that the AECA and its implementing regulations do not create liability for attempting to cause another person to violate it. The government argues that Kuok's case, because it involves conduct that occurred in part in the United States, does not invoke extraterritorial jurisdiction at all. A defendant can only be found guilty of an attempt to commit a federal offense if the statute defining the offense also expressly proscribes an attempt. For the government's theory to be viable, either 18 U.S.C.§ 2(b) would have to contain an attempt provision, or 22 C.F.R.§ 127.1 would haveto contain an attempted causation provision. Since neither statute does so, Kuok cannot be convicted on this count. Kuok challenges his conviction on count two because he argues that the government did not satisfy all of the elements of 18 U.S.C.§ 554. This count is based on Kuok's purchase of the Taclane encryptor. Kuok argues that competing definitions render the statutory text ambiguous and require application of the rule of lenity. Section 554(a) applies to anyone who “receives, [or] conceals] or buys” any merchandise, article, or object contrary to law. Kuok argues that the statute requires proof of his “intent to export.” The government argues that superfluity is not always to be avoided. Kuok argues that the jury instructions with respect to count one are invalid because they allowed the jury to convict based on the “attempt to cause an export” theory of count three. Because we have rejected his arguments and concluded that Kuok's conviction under § 554(a) need not be vacated as a matter of law, we disagree that the Jury instructions were improper. Duress is not a statutory defense, but a common-law defense that allows a jury to find that the defendant's conduct is excused. The burden of proof is on the defendant to show that: (1) he was under an immediate threat of death or serious bodily injury, (2) he had a well grounded fear that the threat would be carried out, and (3) he has no reasonable opportunity to escape. Kuok was told his wife would be arrested and disappear into a secret prison if he refused to cooperate.Kuok believed that Zheng represented the Chinese intelligence service, whose capacity to carry out its threats would be far greater than the run-of-the-mill criminal organization. Zheng knew his family's movements and other intimate details that demonstrated that his family was regularly monitored.",,
10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,case109.txt,"Frederick Aikens, formerly a colonel in the North Carolina Army National Guard, alleged that his former colleagues violated his Fourth Amendment rights by wrongfully intercepting, reading, and forwarding his e-mails while he was deployed in Iraq. The district court dismissed the action without prejudice, concluding that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction because of Colonel Aiken's failure to exhaust any available intramilitary remedies. Colonel Aikens filed a motion for relief from the judgment, pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b)(6) He argued that the judgment should be reopened because he had complied with the court's requirement that he exhaust his intra-service administrative remedies and he now might face a statute of limitations defense if he were to file a new action. Col. Aikens argues that the district court abused its discretion in denying him relief from its prior judgment of dismissal under Rule 60(b)(6) We agree that the issue was made directly addressed by the Supreme Court in a ruling that was made by procedural choices made by Aiken. Colonel Aikens asserts that his personal email was illegally intercepted and used to compel his retirement from the North Carolina Army National Guard (the “NCARNG”) after thirty-two years of service. Those responsible were NCARNG Adjutant General William E. Ingram, Jr., and Lieutenant Colonel Peter von Jess. The district court dismissed the § 1983 claim on the mistaken belief that Aiken was required to exhaust remedies with the Army Board for Correction of Military Records. Colonel Aikens filed a Rule 60(b) motion to seek relief from the ABCMR. The ABCMR determined that it was powerless to act because the relief sought therein was “not within [its] purview.” J.A.43. I cannot join the majority in affirming the denial of Rule 60 (b) relief in Colonel Aiken's request for new civil action. Colonel Aikens is seeking relief under Rule 60(b), which authorizes a court to relieve a party from a final judgment for “any other reason [not spelled out in clauses (1)-(5) ] that justifies relief” To be entitled to Rule 60 (b)(6) relief, the movant must demonstrate “extraordinary circumstances.” Col. Aikens' first timely attempt to have his case heard was dismissed for failure to exhaust intraservice remedies. His second attempt, this time before the ABCMR, as directed by the district court, was rejected. His third attempt, to revive his first lawsuit through Rule 60(b)(6), was denied. The court failed to acknowledge its primary role in creating the statute of limitations predicament. Colonel Aikens zealously objected to the proposition that ABCMR remedies were available and thus had to be exhausted. The federal courts may only forecast how the ABCMR might delineate its own jurisdiction, not define it for it. Colonel Aikens's statute of limitations quandary was the direct result of the district court's mistake, not any tactical decision made by Aiken and his lawyer. The majority merely speculates that its proposed strategies would have solved Akens's timeliness problem. The notion that Colonel Aikes could have initiated a new action is similarly speculative. The court may relieve a party or its legal representative from a final judgment, order, or proceeding for the following reasons. The motion under Rule 60(b) must be made within a reasonable time-and for reasons (1), (2), and (3) no more than a year after the entry of the judgment or order or the date of the proceeding.

12,12,12,12,12,12,12,12,12,12,case119.txt,"Charles G. Willenbring was court-martialed in the late 1990s, while serving in the Army's reserve component. He was found guilty of three rape offenses committed in late 1980s, when he was serving in Army's regular component. In pursuing habeas corpus relief under 28 U.S.C.§ 2241, he contends that he was not subject to court-Martial prosecution. On appeal from the court-martial judgment, the Army Appeals Court affirmed Willenbring's convictions and adopted the military trial court's conclusion that he had not experienced a complete termination of service between his discharge from the Army's regular component on March 31, 1992, and his enlistment in the reserve component on April 1, 1992. On January 12, 2004, after exhaustion of his military court remedies, he petitioned in the Eastern District of North Carolina for habeas corpus relief, pursuant to 28 U.S.C.§ 2241. In June 2005, after the government moved for dismissal, the court dismissed the habea corpus petition. In 2007, Willen A “discharge,” in military terms, is generally understood to be a “complete termination” of military service, but does not include a discharge conditioned upon acceptance of further military service. Supreme Court's decision in United States ex rel.Hirshberg v. Cooke decided that the military was not entitled to institute court-martial proceedings against a servicemember for offenses committed during an earlier enlistment. Willenbring argues that Article 2(d) does not apply to his offenses because the phrase “on active duty”-in subpart (2)(A) thereof-refers only to those offenses committed while the servicemember was on active duty in the Army's reserve component. Willenbring relies for this proposition on the Third Circuit's 1996 Murphy decision. The Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces disagreed with Murphy's reasoning. 10 U.S.C.§ 101 provides a general definition of the term “active duty” applicable to all of Title 10, including the UCMJ. This definition thus encompasses active duty in both the Army's regular component and its reserve component. Congress expressly referenced the reserve component when it meant to restrict its application. In the late 1990s, Willenbring was indicted in North Carolina for six unrelated crimes-four rapes and two kidnappings-and the Army did not seek to exercise jurisdiction over those offenses. North Carolina placed him in pretrial confinement for those offenses on November 1, 1996, and later released him to the Army after the court-martial specifications were preferred. On January 8, 1999, he was convicted of the North Carolina charges and sentenced to life imprisonment, a sentence he is currently serving. Staff Sergeant Willenbring was initially sentenced, on October 14, 1998, to confinement for thirty-six years. Pursuant to a pretrial agreement, the military trial court later reduced his sentence to twenty years. The court-martial judgment is found at J.A.67. Willenbring II, 56 M.J. at 676. The Army Appeals Court further observed that “[t]here was no more a break in [willenbring's] service or status than there is a breakin time as one day or year turns to the next.”  Id. at 749, 95 S.Ct.1300.",,

Wuterich is a Staff Sergeant in the U.S. Marine Corps who in November 2005 led a squad stationed in Iraq.On November 19, 2005, a roadside bomb detonated in the city of Haditha, killing two dozen Iraqi civilians.Wuterich filed suit against John Murtha, the Congressman from Pennsylvania's Twelfth Congressional District, for libel, invasion of privacy/false light, and republication of defamatory statements by third parties. Congressman Murtha's former Communications Director Cynthia Abram stated that three of the media interviews were taped in Pennsylvania when the Congressman “was in his congressional district during a district work period” Abram declaration stated that the interviews were not campaign related and explained that they were conducted in Congressman Murtha’s campaign office because that office was easily accessible to the broadcasters. The Federal Employees Liability Reform and Tort Compensation Act of 1988, commonly known as the Westfall Act, “accords federal employees absolute immunity from common-law tort claims arising out of acts they undertake in the course of their official duties”  Osborn, 549 U.S. at 229, 127 S.Ct.881. The Act's “core purpose,” as the Supreme Court has explained, ‘is to relieve covered employees from the cost and effort of defending the lawsuit’ Wuterich contends that we lack jurisdiction over this appeal, because the District Court's denial of certification pending discovery is not a “final decision” under 28 U.S.C.§ 1291. In this case, appellate jurisdiction arises pursuant to the collateral order doctrine of Cohen v. Beneficial Industrial Loan Corp. The Westfall Act confers absolute, not merely qualified, immunity upon federal employees acting within the scope of their official duties. The fact that the District Court denied the Government's certification pending discovery in no way limits Congressman Murtha's right to seek appellate review. The District Court's decision to deny certification was premised on an erroneous ruling that Wuterich was entitled to discovery. The Government certified that Congressman Ballenger was acting within the scope of his employment. The parties conducted limited discovery which was not an issue on appeal. Wuterich's claim that Congressman Murtha was “harping on Haditha as a way to embarrass the Defense Secretary’s wife” was insufficient to support a claim that the Congressman was acting outside thescope of his job. In Wilson, the court upheld the District Court's ruling that defendant Bush Administration officials had acted within the scope of their employment. Valerie Plame Wilson's husband Joseph C. Wilson IV had been an outspoken critic of the administration's approach to intelligence issues. The court explained that “[o]f course, the defendants may discredit public critics of the Executive Branch.”",,

Buroker states that the specific PDBs Berman requests “contain explicit references to information provided by foreign officials” Buroker warns that such information was provided “only upon a guarantee of absolute secrecy,” and disclosure “would tend to reveal the identities of intelligence sources.” The CIA must do more than show simply that it has acted in good faith. The CIA affidavit we rejected stated without justification that “disclosure of [the withheld] portions reasonably could be expected to lead to identification of the source of the information” Buroker's declaration provides the facts and reasoning upon which his conclusion is based. Berman objects to the CIA's reliance on the “mosaic theory,” which Buroker explains as the concept that some information in specific PDBs may appear harmless to disclose when read in isolation. The Supreme Court endorsed the mosaic theory in Sims, commenting that[B]its and pieces of data may aid in piecing together bits of other information. Berman's request relies heavily upon the assumption that the passage of time-around 40 years-has eroded any support for the assertion that the PDBs contain information about sources or methods that has not already been revealed. Buroker explains, however, that the passing of time has not vitiated the CIA's interest in maintaining the secrecy of the requested P DBs. In that case the district court held that exemption 3 excused the CIA from disclosing its budget. There, as here, it was the content of the documents sought, not the documents themselves, that deserved protection under exemption 3.

15,15,15,15,15,15,15,15,15,15,case118.txt,"Rhodes and Air America moved for summary judgment after CACI sued them for defamation. The district court granted the motion, concluding that Rhodes's statements were protected by the First Amendment. We affirm that Rhodes relied on a number of reputable sources, including two U.S. Army reports and the statements of an army brigadier general. Sources included two official military reports, a published interview of the brigadier general formerly in charge of U.S. prisons in Iraq (including Abu Ghraib), news articles, and a journalist's speech. Rhodes made the statements on her show in August 2005 that CACI challenges as defamatory. The Fay/Jones report detailed forty-four incidents of abuse inflicted by both military and civilian contractor (CACI and Titan) personnel. CACI or Titan employees were responsible in over one-third of the incidents. The report concluded that many of the Abu Ghraib abuses cited could be criminal, and it recommended that its findings with respect to three CACi employees and two Titan employees “be forwarded to the Army General Counsel for determination of whether [the employees] should be referred to the Department of Justice for prosecution. The Pentagon's widespread use of military contractors in Iraq attracted scholarly and media attention prior to and while Rhodes was airing her shows that are the subject of this case. Rhodes devoted parts of her show to the abuses at Abu Ghraib, the issue of military contractor responsibility for those abuses. Statement 4, August 22, 2005 (unregulated contractors and contractor employees): What's sickening is if you're a mercenary, if you go to work for Triple Canopy or Blackwater, first of all, there's no laws. You'll never, ever, ever be court-martialed. You can do any damn thing you want to. Karpinski: ""Contractors were the ones that were actually doing the bad stuff"" ""They were like walking billboards for tyranny, for treachery, for murder!"" ""I really am annoyed that this thing that's being passed on, the cost, for Iraq I'm still going to pay for once I'm older"" CACI sued Rhodes and Air America for defamation under Virginia law. CACI alleges that Rhodes's statements on her show accuse the company of, among other things, torture, rape, murder, and misrepresenting its authority at the Abu Ghraib prison. Rhodes made the statements with reckless disregard as to whether they were false. The First Amendment provides protection for statements that cannot ‘reasonably [be] interpreted as stating actual facts’ about an individual. This safeguard includes protection for “rhetorical hyperbole, a vigorous epithet’ and “loose, figurative, or hyperbolic language’ Rhodes joined in just such a discussion in this instance. CACI contends that the fact that its employees issued instructions to soldiers is irrelevant. CACI argues that Rhodes's sources gave her “no basis whatsoever” for accusing employees of misrepresenting their authority to soldiers or impersonating officers. The district court concluded that the two military reports, together with other sources, support the district court's determination. CACI argues that abuse is not a synonym for torture and that Rhodes must be held to have accused CACI of torture in the sense that word is used in the U.S. criminal code. Rhodes maintains that she used the word “torture” in statement 1 to describe the severe abuse that CACi bore responsibility for at Abu Ghraib, according to her sources. The Fay/Jones report detailed forty-four incidents of abuse at Abu Ghraib, finding that CACI employees were involved in nine. The report recommended that its findings with respect to three CACi employees be forwarded to the Army General Counsel for potential referral to the Department of Justice for prosecution. Rhodes's accusation about child rape has two components:  that children were raped at Abu Ghraib and that CACI bore responsibility for the rape. The First Amendment bars liability for such a defamatory accusation absent clear and convincing proof that the speaker made the accusation “with reckless disregard of whether it was false or not” In statement 4 Rhodes suggests-tongue in cheek-that anyone wishing to torture, kill, or murder should go to work for one of the contractors such as Triple Canopy, Blackwater, CACI, or Titan. The district court concluded that Rhodes's characterizations of Iraq as having “deteriorated into contractor heaven” with “[m]ercenaries all over the country, killing people” (statement 10), J.A.217, and characterizing a list of contractors as “hired killers” were “quintessential examples of hyperbole” Rhodes's statements were “immune from defamation liability” because the reasonable listener would understand that they were not stating actual facts about CACI itself. The district court concluded that Rhodes's purpose in making statements 3 and 12 was to advance a strong and vivid argument that the U.S. government should not use military contractors in Iraq. Rhodes was not saying that CACI committed murder at Abu Ghraib. She simply provided an open-ended list of potential targets for investigation without assigning blame to any particular contractor. Rhodes would not have been speaking with reckless disregard for the truth if she had suggested that CacI was responsible for murder.",,

The appropriate test under federal common law for third-party beneficiary status is whether the contract reflects the intention of the parties to benefit the third party. In most cases, the choice between proceeding via FMS or DCS is a strategic decision based upon the needs of the foreign purchaser or defense contractor. UK MOD purchased goods that were only available via the FMS program. Recognition of UK MOD as a third-party beneficiary of the U.S.-Trimble agreements would be contrary to the AECA because it would afford UK MOD a right exclusive to DCS transactions. UK MOD cannot establish that it was a third-party beneficiary to any of the Trimble-United States agreements. We affirm the district court's decision to grant Trimble's motion to dismiss. We remanded for further proceedings on this issue, including a determination of whether the parties to the contract intended to bestow a benefit on a third party. Trimble contends that where procurement is required to fulfill the terms of a Letter of Agreement, the “back-to-back” contract structure necessarily precludes the third-party beneficiary theory being asserted by UK MOD. The mere fact that a procurement for cash does not involve a direct contractual relationship between the foreign purchaser and the defense contractor does not dictate that UK MOD's claim is statutorily barred.",,
18,18,18,18,18,18,18,18,18,18,case124.txt,"Former Superintendent of the Virginia Military Institute appeals court's ruling. Court: General Bunting is entitled to qualified immunity. VMI is a state-operated military college located in Lexington, Virginia. Military regulations, etiquette, and drills pervade the VMI system, the court says. The Corps must remain standing and silent while the supper prayer is read, but cadets are not obliged to recite the prayer, close their eyes, or bow their heads. The Plaintiffs filed their complaint in the Western District of Virginia, seeking declaratory and injunctive relief, along with nominal damages, costs, and attorney's fees. On January 24, 2002, the district court entered summary judgment in favor of the Plaintiffs. The court concluded that General Bunting was entitled to qualified immunity. When a case has become moot after the entry of the district court's judgment, an appellate court no longer has jurisdiction to entertain the appeal. When students challenge the constitutionality of school policies, their claims for declaratory and injunctive relief generally become moot when they graduate. Graduated students often maintain that their claims fall under an exception to the mootness doctrine. Plaintiffs' claims for declaratory and injunctive relief have become moot through happenstance, we vacate the district court's judgment insofar as it awarded such relief. The damage claim continues to present a live controversy. The court concludes that General Bunting “is entitled to the defense of qualified, good faith immunity.” In Wallace v. Jaffree, 472 U.S. 38, 105 S.Ct.2479, 86 L.Ed.2d 29 (1985), the Court invalidated an Alabama statute mandating a moment of silence in the state's public schools “for meditation or voluntary prayer.” In Wallace, the Court applied the test first enunciated in Lemon v. Kurtzman. In Lee v. Weisman, the Court invalidated a school's practice of inviting a member of the clergy to deliver a nonsectarian prayer at a commencement ceremony. The dominant factor guiding the Court's decision in Lee was the coercive nature of the religious activity. The Court concluded that, even though the students made the decision about whether to pray, the school had created the mechanism by which the decision was made. VMI's pregame prayer had an unduly coercive effect, and that the school had accordingly violated the Establishment Clause. General Bunting contends that we need not reach the “clearly established” prong of the qualified immunity analysis because the Establishment clause does not prohibit VMI's supper prayer. The General insists that prayer before meals is part of the fabric of society. General Bunting suggests that we should view the prayer as a uniquely historical practice. In Marsh, though, the Court was specifically influenced by the fact that, in September of 1789, members of the first Congress voted to submit the First Amendment to the states. The Supreme Court has since emphasized that Marsh is applicable only in narrow circumstances. VMI's cadets are mature adults, who will not feel coerced to participate in the supper prayer. General Bunting suggests that the members of the Corps (other than the rats) may avoid the prayer by falling out of the SRC formation before the Corps enters the mess hall. VMI's children are not unduly influenced by prayers of the sort in question here. At VMI, even upperclassmen must submit to mandatory and ritualized activities, as obedience and conformity remain central tenets of the school's educational philosophy. In this context, VMI's cadets are plainly coerced into participating in a religious exercise. VMI cannot avoid Establishment Clause problems by simply asserting that a cadet's attendance at supper and his or her participation in the supper prayer are “voluntary” In assessing General Bunting's asserted purposes for the supper prayer, we are concerned that he seeks to obscure the difference between educating VMI's cadets about religion and forcing them to practice it. When a state-sponsored activity has an overtly religious character, courts have consistently rejected efforts to assert a secular purpose. In establishing its supper prayer, VMI has done precisely what the First Amendment forbids. VMI's sponsorship of the supper prayer also brings the school into conflict with Lemon 's third prong, excessively entangling it with religious activity. The Establishment Clause protects the government from governmental interference with religious expression. General Bunting is immune from damages unless he violated “clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known.” The Establishment Clause plainly forbids public schools from sponsoring an official prayer for young children. The Supreme Court has never addressed the constitutionality of state-sponsored prayer.",,

The district court concluded that Karagiors had been acting within the scope of his employment as a federal employee at the time of the accident. Erlinda Clamor was injured on a military base in a minor car accident caused by another government employee.Her state court lawsuit was removed to federal district court by the United States. The district court dismissed the case because Mrs.Clamor failed to exhaust her FTCA remedies before bringing suit. The case was reversed and remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. The Government moved to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction based on Clamor's failure to exhaust her federal administrative remedies. The district court granted the motion. The Attorney General may certify that a federal employee was acting within the scope of his employment at the time of the incident giving rise to liability. Kang recognized that the mere fact that an employee was translocated to Hawaii for an indefinite period by his employer is not sufficient (by itself) to impose respondeat superior liability. In Kang, the employee had moved his belongings (including shipping at personal expense his own car) to the island of Kauai, had consumed several beers after work, and, hours later, was involved in a serious car accident while driving his own vehicle to a non-work-related dinner.

Staub alleged that the reasons given-insubordination, shirking, and attitude problems-were just a pretext for discrimination. A jury sided with Staub, and the district court denied Proctor's renewed motion for judgment. Staub's military duty had been a strain on the department. Angio techs were trained to work in both units and therefore had the ability to help out with radiology and the like when the need arose. On January 27, 2004, Mulally gave Staub a warning accusing him of shirking his duties. Staub and Sweborg worked together in the angio department all morning, finishing up around lunchtime. Staub walked to Korenchuk's office to tell him that he and S weborg were going to lunch. Korenukch wasn't there, so Staub left a voice mail informing him they were off to the cafeteria. 30 minutes later, KorenUkch showed up, demanding to know where they had been. He said he was “looking all over” for Staub, and Staub's explanation-that they were only at lunch and left aVoice mail-appeased him little. He escorted Staub down to Buck's office in Human Since Buck was the decisionmaker and there was no evidence she had a problem with Staub on account of his membership in the Reserves, Staub was out of luck under the traditional rubric. Staub sought to attribute Mulally's animus to Buck, and therefore to Proctor. Proctor argues on appeal that the district court mishandled the cat's paw theory. We were, and remain to this day, unprepared to find an employer liable based on a nondecisionmaker's animus unless the “decisionmaker” herself held that title only nominally. If the decision-maker wasn't used as a cat's paw-if she didn't just take the monkey's word for it, as it were-then of course the theory is not in play. We affirmed this principle in Metzger v. Illinois State Police. A new trial is not warranted where the properly considered evidence is insufficient to support the jury's verdict. A reasonable jury could not find that Mulally (or anyone else) had singular influence over Buck. Buck looked beyond what Mulally and Korenchuk said and determined that Staub was a liability to the company. Staub was reinstated after filing a grievance, but with certain conditions in place. Those conditions addressed perceived weakness in availability, attitude, and communication. For instan, Staub was placed on administrative leave. For more on this story, visit CNN.com/Impact.",,

Walch brought suit based on his discharge from the Texas Air National Guard and the loss of his position as a full-time National Guard civilian employee. The district court found the claims to be non-justiciable. The opinion issued in this case on June 6, 2008 is withdrawn and this revised opinion is substituted. Major Walch appealed a district court decision dismissing his claims. The 5th Circuit said the district court erroneously concluded that his claims were non-justiciable. The court also held that dismissal was warranted because Major Walch “fail[ed] to state a claim upon which relief may be granted” Major Walch alleged race and sex discrimination while a federal technician and a member of the Texas National Guard. Walch claims he was the victim of retaliation and that his dismissal from the Guard and the loss of his civilian position were similarly motivated. He is seeking reinstatement, back pay, money damages for the discrimination, and attorneys' fees. The court has jurisdiction under 42 U.S.C.§§ 2000e-5 & 2000e-16. The National Guard Technicians Act of 1968 created an unusual status, mixing state command with federal employment. Congress sought to recognize both the military and state characteristics of the National Guard by providing administrative authority to the states over the technicians. The Feres doctrine was premised on the disruptive nature of judicial second-guessing of military decisions. Major Walch's claims relate to his dual-status service, all arose on Air Force bases or other military locations.Technicians have a dual status.It is not possible to disentangle for these purposes their military role and command structure from their civilian employment. Congress has permitted Title VII claims to be brought by National Guard technicians. There are categories of employees of a state military department other than those involved in the precedents we have discussed. In Meister, the plaintiff was not a dual-status federal technician. Though she separately also served as a traditional Guard member, it was during her week-day civilian job at the Adjutant General's Department that she brought suit. Two judges agreed that Title VII claims by a National Guard technician were justiciable unless they were integrally related to the military. The Federal Circuit concluded that a 1996 statute, which said a technician was a “Federal civilian employee,” affected the applicability of Feres to statutory claims of discrimination. Major Walch claims a conspiracy by various members of the Texas National Guard. The alleged injuries all involve exempt personnel decisions. Walch argues that he was entitled to a board hearing, citing Cole v. Tex.Army Nat'l Guard, 909 S.W.2d 535 (TexApp.1995). Gough v.

26,26,26,26,26,26,26,26,26,26,case286.txt,"This appeal requires us to assess whether the Army complied with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (“NEPA”), 42 U.S.C.§§ 4321-4347 (2006), in planning its programs to modernize and streamline its forces. While the metamorphosis of the Army and the strategic planning accompanying this transformation is the business of. the Army, the Army's compliance with NEPA does involve us. The Army did not invite state and local agencies to participate in scoping for the PEIS. The Army noted internally that there was “[v]irtually no public response to ‘scoping.’” The Army provided notice of the pending PEIS in the Federal Register and in USA Today, not in the Hawaiian media. The Army's own experts recognized the shortcomings of the PEIS and its ROD not long after they were published. The minutes of an internal June 2002 meeting preparing for the SEIS indicate that “the PEIS does not contain specific language about why each of the five sites was selected.” The Army held seven scoping meetings between April 16 and 30, 2002, five on Oahu. ‘Ilio’Ulaokalani Coalition v. Rumsfeld, 369 F.Supp.2d 1246, 1253 (D.Haw.2005) Plaintiffs were barred from arguing the insufficiency of the alternatives considered in the PEIS because they had not submitted comments to the Army. Plaintiffs have not waived their right to challenge the sufficiency of the Army's consideration of reasonable alternatives. The Army had independent knowledge of the very issue that concerns Plaintiffs in this case, such that “there is no need for a commentator to point them out specifically in order to preserve its ability to challenge a proposed action” An agency decision may be set aside if it is “arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.” The Army adopted a “tiered” approach to its compliance with NEPA, preparing a programmatic EIS followed by a site-specific EIS. Friends of Southeast's Future v. Morrison, 153 F.3d 1059, 1065 (9th Cir.1998), rev'd on other grounds, 490 U.S. 332, 109 S. Ct.1835, 104 L.Ed.2d 351 (1989), aff'd on remand, 879 F. 2d 705 (9rd Cir.1989) The court found that the existence of reasonable but unexamined alternatives renders an EIS inadequate. The Army settled on transformation of the 2nd Brigade in Hawaii in the PEIS. It reached this decision with no analysis of the environmental impacts or of reasonable alternatives to such a transformation. The Army violated NEPA by not considering alternatives that include transformation outside of Hawaii. It then leaps to the assumption that transformation in Hawaii or no action are the only alternatives. This is where the impermissible “narrowing” takes place. The Army argues that the record demonstrates that transformation of the 2nd Brigade in Hawaii is of strategic importance. Other locations in the United States with proximity to the Pacific Rim have been designated for early transformation. The Army had already started transformation of brigades at Fort Lewis, Washington. KLOA consists of 23,348 acres on the western slope of the Ko’olau Mountain Range, of which 5,310 acres are suitable for maneuver training activities. Appellee argues that the Army's assertion that Hawaii offers unique training areas for the 2nd Brigade once it has been transformed into a Stryker Brigade is “fully consistent with the actual training terrain available” The purpose and need of the Army's overall transformation is to modernize its brigade units as quickly and efficiently as possible, while maintaining combat readiness. The Army reasonably decided such transformation would proceed “in place,” i.e., at each brigade's present base location. The plaintiffs failed to raise their “concerns” through the prescribed administrative process and should therefore not be granted relief when they arrive at the federal courts. Plaintiffs' argument that the Army had to consider relocation of the 2nd Brigade ignores (and fails to challenge) the elephant in the living room. The Army had already determined that to achieve its purpose and need, transformation of all units, including the2nd Brigade in Hawaii, would be accomplished “in place.” Each of the seventy brigade-sized units would be transformed, one at a time, at Camp X. Equipping and transforming a Stryker Brigade Combat Team takes two years, plus an additional period to reach Final Operational Capability. The Army chose to foreclose a more circuitous route to transformation in the PEIS. The AEC's Licensing Board granted a permit for construction of the plants and its Appeal Board affirmed. Saginaw moved to have the AEC clarify its ruling and reopen proceedings on the power plants. The Supreme Court reversed the decision and remanded for further proceedings. In Department of Transportation v. Public Citizen, 541 U.S. 752, 124 S. Ct.2204, 159 L.Ed.2d 60 (2004), the Supreme Court unanimously reaffirmed its view that, under NEPA, would-be intervenors must participate meaningfully in agency proceedings. The majority is correct that the court refused to adopt a “broad rule which would require participation in agency proceedings as a condition precedent to seeking judicial review of an agency decision.” But the majority's insistence to the contrary, Kunaknana v. Clark, 742 F.2d 1145 (9th Cir 1984), does not require a different result here. Plaintiffs have not identified any exceptional circumstances warranting their excusal from Vermont Yankee's requirement. In Kunaknana, the exceptional circumstances that justified the court's carving out an exception to the Vermont Yankee rule was to effectuate Congress's special protection for Eskimos in ANILCA. The Army's SEIS states its purpose as to assist in bringing the Army's Interim Force to operational capability and to provide realistic field training in Hawai’i. The Army also met its obligation in the SEIS to consider reasonable alternatives to the proposed action of transforming the 2nd Brigade in Hawaii. Selection of the no-action alternative would have caused the 2nd Brigade not to be transformed into a Stryker brigade. Because this option had substantially similar environmental consequences as full relocation, the Army did not also separately have to consider relocation of the2nd Brigade. The Army's consideration of these alternatives establishes that the Army looked at reasonable alternatives to transformation in Hawaii. “The PEIS leaves us short on alternatives.The only alternatives we have are no action versus action.”  Timothy Julius commented that the “EIS is woefully inadequate:  The alternatives are meaningless.Where is the ‘analysis' of installations?”",,

Wyeth's employee relations director put forth affidavit evidence that employees who received a low performance rating were not eligible to apply to other internal positions until the PIP was completed. The PIP itself documented Vega's various employee performance issues. The PIP itself stated that although Vega completed the set goals, it was being extended because of: (1) an email Vega sent in which he described a supervisor in a disrespectful manner; (2) a letter Vega improperly solicited his co-workers to sign attesting to his job performance; and (3) Vega's authorized leave. Vega testified that one of his supervisors, Andrew Espejo (“Espejo”), informed him that he did not pass the PIP because his performance was affected by his military service. Vega alleges that dating back to October 2006, he was subjected to comments and name calling by various Wyeth supervisors, related to his military service.

Hamad is seeking damages from the United States military and civilian officers for his detention and treatment at Guantanamo. He argues that federal courts had jurisdiction under the then-effective version of the habeas corpus statute. Hamdi v. Rumsfeld, 542 U.S. 507, 510, 124 S.Ct.2633, 159 L.Ed.2d 578 (2004) § 2241 imposed two additional jurisdictional limitations: first, “no court, justice, or judge” could entertain “an application for a writ of habeas corpus filed by” a Guantanamo detainee. Second, no court could entertained “any other action against the United States or its agents relating to any aspect of the detention by the Department of Defense of an alien at Guantanamo Bay.” Hamad argues that we should read Boumediene as striking down all of § 2241(e), not just the subsection dealing with habeas petitions. We disagree. The logic and context of the opinion make clear that the Supreme Court was addressing only the subsection. Congressional intent serves as the basis for this severability test. Congress dealt separately with two different categories of actions that could be brought by Guantanamo detainees. Congress sought to bar alien detainees from applying for habeas corpus as reflected in 28 U.S.C.§ 2241(e)(1) Hamad argues that § 2241(e) is unconstitutional, because it deprives him of a federal forum to seek a remedy for violations of his constitutional rights. We disagree. Hamad is correct that the Supreme Court has avoided the question whether Congress may completely deny a plaintiff access to federal forum. But we can likewise avoid addressing this difficult issue, because Hamad seeks only money damages. Congress enacted § 2241(e) to limit and channel federal court review of detention and military commission decisions, not to impose any particular punishment on military detainees. Hamad argues that this distinction “serves no compelling legislative purpose and would not survive strict scrutiny” The Supreme Court has not determined whether the Fifth Amendment's protections even apply to Hamad. Gates became Secretary of Defense in December 2006. Because Hamad was transferred from Guantanamo in December 2007, Gates's tenure as Secretary overlapped with Hamad's detention at Guantanamo for one year. The ARB decision was heavily redacted and the explanation and reasoning for the panel's decision is blacked out. Statements on the floor of the House also indicate that Congress intended to limit detainee lawsuits. Hamad notes that Congress titled § 7 of the MCA as “Habeas Corpus Matters.” It is well-established that the title of a statute can be used to preserve a jurisdictional bar.",,

In April 1998 Hill was placed in a position in the “Q-Laboratory” section of “Service R.” Hill contends that he reported to the Q-Laboratories and that his new supervisor looked “distraught” when Hill informed him about Hill's Reserve obligations. Hill challenged the termination through Michelin's “fair treatment” program. Hill argued that other Michelin employees who made mistakes on their time cards were not terminated and that Michelin treated him differently because of his Reserve status. The review board ruled in favor of Michelin, concluding that Hill knew about the vacation day when he filled out the time card and that Hill intentionally falsified his time card. The Q-Laboratory operates under an eight-hour/seven-day rotating shift. The Service Z position required Hill to work some twelve-hour days during each shift. Just as a first shift job is generally preferred over a third shift job, most workers would also prefer a more regular schedule of shorter work days. Hill's complaint about the way the investigation was conducted and the result of the investigation are insufficient to create a genuine issue of material fact as to the relevant questions. We conclude that the transfer from the Q-Laboratory to Service Z must be considered a denial of a benefit of employment under USERRA. We reverse the district court's grant of summary judgment in favor of Michelin on Hill's transfer claim and remand for further proceedings.",,

McCarty v. McCarty, 453 U.S. 210, 101 S.Ct. 2728, 69 L.Ed.2d 589 (1981) The Court found an irreconcilable conflict between the federal statutes governing military retirement pay and state law that treated pay earned during marriage as spousal property. The plaintiffs are either retired armed service members drawing retirement pay or active duty members who will be eligible for this pay on retirement.On various dates between 1978 and 2003, these 58 individuals were all divorced.They are subject to state court divorce orders granting their former spouses a portion of their retirement pay.DFAS makes direct payments to the former spouses of at least some of the plaintiffs. In March 2005 the district court concluded that ULSG had standing to bring the equal protection, procedural due process, and uniformity claims. The court held that the Act violated the substantive component of the Due Process Clause by retroactively reaching the retirement pay of service members who joined before the Act's passage. The Rooker-Feldman doctrine, a corollary to this rule, prohibits “lower federal courts ” from exercising appellate jurisdiction over final state-court judgments. The plaintiffs seek a declaration that the Act is unconstitutional as applied to them. The Act applies to these plaintiffs by requiring the Armed Forces to transmit payments to qualifying former spouses pursuant to state court divorce decrees. A federal court declaration would invalidate the statutory basis for the federal payments mechanism. The Act does not exempt service members who joined the armed forces prior to its enactment from state court divorce decrees dividing their military retirement pay upon divorce. The plaintiffs allege that the lack of these exemptions retroactively alters the compensation they expected when hired. They contend that this retroactivity amounts to a violation of the substantive component of the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment. Only two plaintiffs in this case allege that they were divorced before the Act was signed into law in September 1982. The plaintiffs argue that the Act “give[s] rise to disparate treatment to service members” and that it “produces non-uniform results when implemented in state law. The plaintiffs argue that the Act violates their constitutional right to equal protection by distinguishing between persons based on three classifications. They allege that allowing the former husbands of female service members to receive a share of their retirement pay is “manifestly unfair,” as these former husbands in many cases have their own income. The plaintiffs argue that the Act unconstitutionally favors the former spouses over service members. The Act survives this rational basis review. Congress exhibited special concern for the personal and economic sacrifices that the spouse of a military service member makes to sustain the marriage. Congress could have properly concluded that those sacrifices were even more intense than the ordinary sacrifices associated with marriage to civilian employees. The Constitution simply does not compel Congress to provide for the service members a system entirely identical to the one created for other government officers. The decision whether to include a remarriage cutoff in the statute is properly left to Congress. If one purpose of allowing the former spouse to receive a portion of the military retirement pay is to provide economic support, Congress was not obligated to assume that the need for this support would always disappear. The Secretary contends that Endicott-Johnson forecloses the plaintiff's procedural due process attack because the state court divorce proceedings give members all the notice that they are due. The district court went on to examine the Act and the regulations using the balancing test first articulated in Mathews v. Eldridge, 424 U.S. 319, 335, 96 S. Ct.893. More intensive review would slow payments processing. DFAS sends monthly retirement pay distributions to about 54,000 former spouses. If DFAS did not want to increase case-processing time, it would have to hire additional staff, which would raise the government's total expenses for running the payments mechanism.",,

Escher contends he was terminated in retaliation for complaints he made about BWXT's designation and accounting of his military leave time. The district court granted summary judgment to BWXT, and we AFFIRM. Escher argues that the district court overlooked that the investigation into his computer use was launched on August 17, less than 30 days after he filed his second complaint concerning BWXT's modified military leave policy. Escher's protected activities were not a motivating factor in the employer's action. Escher argues that the record creates a genuine issue of material facts as to whether his Naval Reserve work constituted “official U.S. Government use” or whether it was “incidental use.” Employment at BWXT is subject to the Employee Handbook: Standards of Business Conduct and Business Ethics.  BWXT has a long record showing that it maintains a generous military leave policy. The only other employee found to have used BWXT's computer system for personal gain was an African American female who was terminated after sending or receiving 200 e-mails regarding her hat-selling business. Escher's burden to show that the other employees' acts were of ""comparable seriousness"" to his own infraction.

Hamdan's captors turned him over to the American military, which transported him to the Guantanamo Bay Naval Base in Cuba. He was charged with conspiracy to commit attacks on civilians and civilian objects, murder and destruction of property by an unprivileged belligerent, and terrorism. In November 2004, Hamdan filed a petition for habeas corpus. The court held that Hamdan could not be tried by a military commission unless a competent tribunal determined that he was not a prisoner of war. Hamdan argues that a military commission has no jurisdiction over him and that any trial must be by court-martial. His claim falls within the exception to Councilman and is firmly supported by the Supreme Court's disposition of Quirin. Hamdan's jurisdictional challenge, by contrast, is not insubstantial, as our later discussion should demonstrate. Ex parte Quirin also stands solidly against Hamdan's argument. Court held that Congress had authorized military commissions through Article 15 of the Articles of War. Hamdan tried to distinguish Quirin and Yamashita on the ground that the military commissions there were in “war zones” while Guantanamo is far removed from the battlefield. In Eisentrager, German nationals, convicted by a military commission in China of violating the laws of war and imprisoned in Germany, sought writs of habeas corpus in federal district court. The Supreme Court, speaking through Justice Jackson, wrote in an alternative holding that the Convention was not judicially enforceable. Hamdan chose to ignore the decision in his brief. Hamdan argues that the habeas corpus statute permits courts to enforce the “treaty-based individual rights” set forth in the Geneva Convention. Eisentrager: That a court has jurisdiction over a claim does not mean the claim is valid. Hamdan also contends that a military commission trial would violate his rights under Article 102. The issue is not whether the commission may try Hamdan, but rather how it may try him. The district court interpreted the final qualifying clause to mean that military commissions must comply in all respects with the requirements of the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ) The UCMJ takes care to distinguish between “courts-martial” and “military commissions. Hamdan does not allege that the regulations establishing the present commission violate any of the pertinent provisions. The President found that Hamdan was not a prisoner of war under the Convention. Hamdan claims that AR 190-8 entitles him to have a “competent tribunal” determine his status. But we believe the military commission is such a tribunal.",,

The disputed question is whether Mrs. Brown and the two Brown children were foreseeable victims of any failure on the part of the VA to diagnose Mr. Brown with Leishmaniasis.

38,38,38,38,38,38,38,38,38,38,case372.txt,"Rev.D. Philip Veitch, formerly a Lieutenant Commander in the Navy Chaplain Corps, appeals from the district court's grant of summary judgment to the Navy. His complaint alleged that he had been constructively discharged for unconstitutional reasons. The district court concluded that since Veitch had resigned voluntarily, he lacked standing to bring his constitutional claims. Veitch sued the Navy and several of its officers in federal district court in December 2000. The court granted summary judgment for defendants. Veitch then filed a six-count amended complaint alleging Free Speech, Establishment, and Free Exercise claims;  Claims for constructive discharge; and violations of the Religious Freedom Restoration Act. Veitch's argument seems to be that if the Navy's actions against him were unlawful, then they were per se coercive, whether or not those actions would actually force a reasonable person in Veitch's position to resign. For this extraordinary proposition, Veitch relies on one Court of Claims case, Roskos v. United States, 213 Ct.Cl.34, 549 F.2d 1386. The district court concluded that Veitch had not presented a triable issue of fact on the question of intolerable work conditions. Veitch argues that the district court ignored evidence of a hostile work environment and failed to give Veitch the inferences to which he is entitled as the nonmoving party on a motion for summary judgment. The NIG reported that Coyne, Buchmiller, and Gray's actions did not violate the Whistleblower Protection Statute. Veitch could not point the finger at his commanding officers to explain his disciplinary problems. Even if Zoeller's conclusions had been palpably unconstitutional, the fact that there was no retaliation for the EO Complaint means that Veitch's request would still have been denied. Rev.Veitch claims that his resignation was forced because of past discrimination-which he tolerated while engaging in an exchange of emails with Captain Buchmiller. The court noted that what would drive a reasonable person to resign “may vary with the character of the job for which the employee was hired and thus, indirectly, with the employee's skills” It held that the plaintiffs had presented no triable issue of fact on the question of constructive discharge.",,
39,39,39,39,39,39,39,39,39,39,case123.txt,"Yaser Esam Hamdi filed a petition under 28 U.S.C.§ 2241 challenging the lawfulness of his confinement in the Norfolk Naval Brig. Hamdi apparently was born in Louisiana but left for Saudi Arabia when he was a small child. The petition alleges that Hamdi is a citizen of the United States who was residing in Afghanistan. Yaser Esam Hamdi is apparently an American citizen. He was also captured by allied forces in Afghanistan, a zone of active military operations. This dual status-that of American citizen and that of enemy combatant-raises important questions about the role of the courts in times of war. The Supreme Court has underscored this founding principle:   “The ultimate purpose of this separation of powers is to protect the liberty and security of the governed.” The courts must defend the “fundamental principles of liberty and justice which lie at the base of all our civil and political institutions,” the court says. Hamdi's petition falls squarely within the Great Writ's purview, since he is an American citizen challenging his summary detention for reasons of state necessity. The safeguards that all Americans have come to expect in criminal prosecutions do not translate neatly to the arena of armed conflict. Detention of enemy combatants serves at least two vital purposes. On this appeal, it is argued that Hamdi's detention is invalid even if the government's assertions were entirely accurate. The burden of the August 16 order would necessarily outweigh any benefits if, quite independent of the disputed factual issues, Hamdi were already entitled to relief. Hamdi argues that there is no congressional sanction for his incarceration and that § 4001(a) therefore prohibits his continued detention. Hamdi and amici contend that Article 5 of the Geneva Convention applies to Hamdi's case and requires an initial formal determination of his status as an enemy belligerent “by a competent tribunal. This argument falters also because theGeneva Convention is not self-executing, the court says. Hamdi's petition fails as a matter of law. The government should not be compelled to produce the materials described in the district court's August 16 order. The district court indicated that its production request might well be only an initial step in testing the factual basis of Hamdi's enemy combatant status. The court's order allows the government to redact “intelligence matters” from its responses. Hamdi's petition alleges that he was a resident of and seized in Afghanistan, a country in which hostilities were authorized and ongoing at the time of the seizure. The Government's response asserts that Hamdi is being detained pursuant to the Commander-in-Chief's Article II war powers. We think the government's assertion of the power to detain Hamdi under the war power is insufficient. Hamdi was captured in a zone of active combat operations in a foreign country. No evidentiary hearing or factual inquiry on our part is necessary or proper. Courts are ill-positioned to police the military's distinction between those in the arena of combat who should be detained and those who should not. Hamdi's citizenship rightfully entitles him to file this petition to challenge his detention, but the fact that he is a citizen does not affect the legality of his detention as an enemy combatant. Hamdi contends that his petition does not implicate military concerns because “the underlying claims in this case are designed to test the legality. of Hamdi's imprisonment in a naval brig in Norfolk, Virginia, not a military determination made overseas.” Hamdi is not “any American citizen alleged to be an enemy combatant” by the government. He is an American citizen captured and detained by American allied forces in a foreign theater of war during active hostilities. Hamdi's status as a citizen cannot displace our constitutional order or the place of the courts within the Framer's scheme.",,

The Government conceded that the stop of Hawkins's truck was a seizure, and that the officers had neither probable cause to arrest Hawkins nor an individualized suspicion of wrongdoing. To justify the warrantless stop, the Government introduced evidence that the base commander had ordered that vehicles entering or leaving McClellan be stopped for inspection. The stop was not subjectively intrusive. The Government's interest in maintaining national security and promoting public safety on base roadways outweighed the brief and limited intrusion resulting from stopping Hawkins at the Peacekeeper gate.

He appealed the removal action to the Merit Systems Protection Board (‘MSPB’).The MSPB affirmed the action.This court vacated the MSPb's decision and remanded for the M SPB to determine whether Mr.Romero could show harmful error resulting from the DoD's failure to follow its own procedures. Mr. Romero's employer requested that the DIA–CAF grant him SCI access. After conducting an investigation, the DIACAF informed Mr. Romero that a preliminary decision had been made to deny him clearance for access to SCI. The final decision indicated that the potential security risks included “the fact that your spouse is not a U.S. citizen, and is an accredited diplomat of the Government of Honduras” The administrative judge rejected Mr. Romero's due process argument because he had the opportunity to challenge the DIA–CAF's final decision and because the agency's regulations do not require an opportunity for review of a reciprocal acceptance of a security clearance revocation. The MSPB administrative judge again affirmed the DoD's action. Mr. Romero contends that the MSPB committed legal error by misapplying the statutes and regulations defining procedures for security clearance determinations. He argues that the DIASAB did not explicitly revoke his Secret clearance. The government counters that DoD regulations plainly permit DoD components like the WHS to designate other components to revoke security clearances. Mr. Romero contends that this result is unjust because different standards apply for access to SCI and eligibility for a Secret security clearance. While this is partially true, this argument misses the mark because there are standards under the common adjudicative guidelines that apply to both. The MSPB's conclusion that the DIA–CAF was authorized to revoke Mr. Romero's security clearance is correct as a matter of law and supported by substantial evidence.",,

The district court granted summary judgment in favor of the government. In Rothe III, we reversed the district court's judgment, holding that the court did not properly apply strict scrutiny in analyzing the constitutionality of section 1207. The court also denied Rothe's request for attorney fees. Rothe's claim to an award of the 1998 contract is moot because the contract was directed to the provision of computer-related services over a specific time period that has now passed. The government also contends that the court lacks jurisdiction to consider Rothe's claim that section 1207, as presently reauthorized, is facially unconstitutional. The government's argument is based on the procedural history of this case on remand. Rothe contends that the district court's findings and legal analysis do not support a holding that the present reauthorization of section 1207 is facially constitutional. The government argues that remand is required to develop the record so that legally sufficient findings can be made. We find it troubling that the government appears to have argued in favor of the very narrowing that it now claims to be erroneous. The government's claim that it was prevented from introducing evidence is weakened by its failure to cite in its appellate briefing to any specific evidence it would have introduced. Both parties would have been well-served to request clarification from the district court before submitting their summary judgment motions.

The Government argues that the District Court misinterpreted this Court's decision in Brosius v. Warden when it applied the state-prisoner habeas standard, § 2254, to Armann. After exhausting all military remedies, they petitioned for habeas corpus relief in federal district court. The district court dismissed the petitions, basing the dismissal on its finding that the military courts had jurisdiction. The Court of Appeals affirmed the dismissal, but gave the petitions “full consideration on their merits,” a broader scope of review than previously afforded. Brosius affirms the conviction of Boumediene v. Bush, 128 S. Ct. 2229, 2286, 171 L.Ed.2d 41 (2008) (Roberts, C.J., dissenting) The scope of federal habeas review is traditionally more limited in some contexts than in others, depending on the status of the detainee. On appeal, we affirmed the district court's order denying habeas relief, Brosius, 278 F.3d at 250, but based our reasoning on different grounds. We interpreted Burns as holding “that in considering a. constitutional claim involving a pure question of law or a mixed question of. law and fact, a federal court may not exercise de novo review’  . We then stated: “[W]e will assume-but solely for the sake of argument-that we may review determinations made by the military courts in this case as if they were determination made by state courts” A federal court's ""limited function"" in reviewing a servicemember's habeas petition is to determine whether the military courts have “dealt fully and fairly with an allegation raised in that application.” The CAAF noted that it was deciding the appropriate standard “for collateral review within the military justice system” Armann had sufficient opportunity to raise his competency claim during the court-martial. The Board of Review discussed only the “colorably creditable” claims. The Court of Military Appeals denied, in a single-sentence order, the petition for grant of review of the Board's decision. Armann argued that the types, amounts, and combination of medications that he was made to take while incarcerated resulted in him being involuntary intoxicated during his guilty plea trial. In its opposition to Armann's motion to attach exhibits, the Government observed that Armann asserted in his Statement and Verification that the medications were not relevant to his new trial petition. The Government's failure to fully brief the competency issue does not preclude a finding that the CAAF fully considered Arman's detailed arguments. Only on appeal to the CAAF did Armann, for the first time, raise the mental competency issue. The CAAF had discretion whether to grant or deny Armann's petition for review, see 10 U.S.C.§ 867, but chose to grant it nevertheless.

The United States filed this appeal over which we have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C.§ 1295(a)(3).II. The primary issue in this appeal is the interrelationship between 10 U.s.C’s§ 1186 and TERA, a temporary force reduction tool. Section 1186(b)(1) is a mandatory statute requiring retirement pay for an officer if he or she is “eligible for voluntary retirement under any provision of law.” The dispute centers on whether eligibility under TERA requires explicit approval by the Navy. The Navy's policy as expressed by NAVADMIN 111/93 established Mr. Clary's eligibility pursuant to TERA. The Navy's NAVADMIN 111/93 implemented a temporary early retirement authority (TERA) authorized until 30 Sep 95 to help facilitate personnel drawdown. The government argues that this holding effectively grants officers who are subject to separation, by reason of misconduct or substandard performance, greater rights than those who otherwise voluntarily leave the service. Mr. Clary points to no explicit waiver of sovereign immunity allowing recovery of back pay for recovery of interest. In 1992, Congress granted the service secretaries temporary authority to offer early retirement to selected service members with at least 15 years of active duty service. Mr. Clary was not “eligible for retirement” at the time he was removed, and he therefore was not entitled to the retirement benefits awarded him by the Court of Federal Claims.",,

The court disagreed with Wagner that the ABCMR's conclusion was based on pure speculation over what the Secretary would have done if the regulation had been followed. Geoffrey Engels, like Sanders, was an officer in the Air Force when he was twice passed over for promotion by selection boards. The Court of Claims found that Engels had successfully demonstrated that the error in his records was not harmless and ordered his reinstatement. The second line of cases involves procedural errors regarding the composition of military selection boards and holds that, in these instances, harmless error review is inapplicable. The court in Doyle articulated two justifications for refusing to apply the harmless error rule:  (1) avoiding the erosion of essential components of a fair trial; and (2) the inability of a reviewing body to assess the magnitude of the error. The court in Evensen also explained that fundamental errors are not limited to statutory procedural error, but may also result from violations of regulations and even internal operating procedures. I respectfully dissent from the majority's holding that the decision of the Department of the Army Active Duty Board (“DAADB”) on the merits must be set aside.

The Secretary denied the petition and published its denial in the Federal Register on January 12, 2009. The PMOI filed a timely petition for review on February 11, 2009 under 8 U.S.C.§ 1189(c). It asks us to vacate the Secretary's decision and remand with instructions to revoke its FTO designation based on a lack of substantial support in the record. Alternatively, the PMOi says the Secretary did not comply with the due process requirements set forth in our earlier decisions. The standard of review is the same under both versions of the statute whether we review a “designation,” a ‘redesignation’ or a � “petition for revocation.” See id.§ 1189(a)(4)(B) (2003) (redesignedation appropriate if “relevant circumstances” initially warranting designation “still exist”) with id.¶ 1189 (a)(6) (revocation appropriate if circumstances that were the basis for the designation have changed in such a manner as to warrant revocation) In other instances, the Secretary cited a source that it seemed to regard as credible but did not indicate to what part of the statute the source's information was relevant. It is unclear whether the Secretary believes that fundraising under false pretenses is direct evidence of terrorist activity or instead bears on the PMOI's “capability” to engage in terrorist activity.",,
48,48,48,48,48,48,48,48,48,48,case411.txt,"Jason Carl Kennedy was disenrolled from the Navy Reserve Officer Training Corps (NROTC) program at George Washington University. He failed to complete the required course at the Officer Candidate School (OCS) in Quantico, VA. Mr. Kennedy challenged his disenrollment by suit in the United States Court of Federal Claims. Mr. Kennedy stopped receiving scholarship benefit payments in August of 2006. In March 2007, the Commanding General of the Marine Corps Recruiting Command executed a letter to the GWU NROTC Unit ordering that Mr. Kennedy be disenrolled from the Unit. The U.S. filed a motion on December 20, 2013, to send the case to the BCNR. The BCNR issued its decision on October 15, 2014. Mr. Kennedy argued that the Navy failed to conduct a required medical examination before disenrolling him, thus violating statutory and regulatory rights. He argued that he had been denied the right to appear before the August 17 PRB, again with the effect of undermining the legality of his disenrollment. The Court of Federal Claims concluded that each of these arguments lacked merit. Mr. Kennedy's disenrollment was not the first thing that came to mind when he was asked to look at the list of items. Mr. Kennedy was required to complete the list before he was able to begin his search for the items. The list includes items such as the number of feet, number of inches, and number of miles. Mr. Kennedy was expelled from campus housing in November 2005 after an altercation with his roommate, an attempt to fling himself out of a window, and psychological counseling. Following reports by his platoon, company, and battalion commanders of emotional instability, Mr. Kennedy appeared before a Commanding Officer's Board at Quantico on June 22, 2006. The D.C.Circuit ruled that the disenrollment recommendation of the Performance Review Board, made in view of his discharge from Officer Candidate School without permission to reapply, was harmful error warranting judicial intervention.",,
49,49,49,49,49,49,49,49,49,49,case100.txt,"Jose Padilla was convicted of conspiring with others within the United States to support al Qaeda's global campaign of terror. Padilla claims that he was repeatedly abused, threatened with torture, deprived of basic necessities, and unjustifiably cut off from access to the outside world. The Supreme Court vacated Padilla's petition that should have been filed in South Carolina. Padilla claims that, as a U.S. citizen captured within the United States, he was unconstitutionally designated as an enemy combatant.Padilla alleges a range of constitutional violations stemming from his ensuing military detention.As relief, Padilla seeks a declaration that his designation, military detention, and treatment in custody were unconstitutional. In the forty years since Bivens, the Supreme Court has monitored the limits of judicial competence to design implied remedies. The Constitution delegates authority over military affairs to Congress and to the President as Commander in Chief. The Court has itself “consistently refused to extend Biven liability to any new context or new category of defendants” Padilla V, 423 F.3d 386, 555 U.S. 7, 24, 26 (2008) The need to hesitate before using Bivens actions to stake out a role for the judicial branch seems clear. It is settled that courts “accord the President the deference that is his when he acts pursuant to a broad delegation of authority from Congress” The complaint asserts that in May 2004, defendant Rumsfeld ordered the Naval Inspector General, Vice Admiral Albert T. Church, to conduct a review of detentions at the Naval Consolidated Brig where Padilla was held. The complaint seeks quite candidly to have the judiciary review and disapprove sensitive military decisions made after extensive deliberations within the executive branch. Padilla asks us to ignore ample evidence that “congressional inaction has not been inadvertent,” he writes. He argues that Congress acted with a “greater ability to evaluate the broader ramifications of a remedial scheme” than we possess. The problems of administrability here are at least two-fold. Padilla argues that a Bivens action will not require courts to do much more than they are doing already. He argues that cases like Stanley and Chappell do not apply to him because he is not a member of the armed forces. The source of hesitation is the nature of the suit and the consequences flowing from it, not just the identity of the plaintiff. Padilla challenged his military detention in habeas corpus proceedings before five different courts. He also brought suit under the Religious Freedom Restoration Act. The Supreme Court has warned that “the full protections that accompany challenges to detentions in other settings may prove unworkable and inappropriate in the enemy-combatant setting.” Padilla contends that RFRA allows him to challenge circumstances of his military detention. Supreme Court: RFRA does not authorize tort suits by members of the military for injuries sustained while engaged in military service. Court: It would run counter to basic notions of notice and fair warning to hold that personal liability in such an unsettled area of law. RFRA was an effort to reverse the Supreme Court's denial of a free exercise claim in Emp't Div., Dep't of HumResof Oregon v. Smith, 494 U.S. 872 (1990) (holding that the Free Exercise Clause does not require accommodation of a religious practice) RFRA does not create a cause of action allowing military regulations to be challenged in civilian courts. Padilla's final claim is that the district court erred in concluding that he lacked standing to seek an order enjoining the government from designating him as an enemy combatant in the future. The standing doctrine gives practical effect to the Constitution's “fundamental limits on federal judicial power in our system of government”",,
50,50,50,50,50,50,50,50,50,50,case266.txt,"Al-Haramain Islamic Foundation, a designated terrorist organization, and two of its attorneys brought suit against President Bush and other executive branch agencies and officials. They claimed that they were subject to warrantless electronic surveillance in 2004 in violation of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. The government countered that the suit is foreclosed by the state secrets privilege, an evidentiary privilege that protects national security and military information. Al-Haramain is a Muslim charity which is active in more than 50 countries. Its activities include building mosques and maintaining various development and education programs. The U.N. Security Council has identified Al- Haramain as an entity belonging to or associated with Al Qaeda. The government moved to dismiss the case, or in the alternative, for summary judgment, on the basis of state secrets privilege. The state secrets privilege is a common law evidentiary privilege that permits the government to bar the disclosure of information if “there is a reasonable danger” that disclosure will “expose military matters which, in the interest of national security, should not be divulged”  United States v. Reynolds, 345 U.S. 1, 10, 73 S. Ct.528, 97 L.Ed.727 (1953). The privilege is not to be lightly invoked. Al-Haramain challenges warrantless surveillance authorized under the TSP. Until disclosure of the program in 2005, the program and its details were a highly prized government secret. Attorney General Gonzales confirmed that surveillance occurred without FISA warrants. U.S. citizens could be surveilled only if they communicated with a suspected or known terrorist. Khaled El-Masri, a German citizen of Lebanese descent, brought claims stemming from injuries allegedly received during his detention under the Central Intelligence Agency's (“CIA”) “extraordinary rendition” program. The government defended the suit on the basis of the state secrets privilege. The Fourth Circuit upheld the government's assertion of thestate secrets privilege and dismissed the action. Al-Haramain's case does involve privileged information, but that fact alone does not render the very subject matter of the action a state secret. We affirm the district court's denial of dismissal on that basis. Two claims of privilege are at issue, although they are intertwined and refer generally to both under the rubric of the Sealed Document. Al-Haramain says he is subject to NSA surveillance. The government says the Sealed Document is protected by the state secrets privilege. The court says the privilege is exceptionally well documented. The panel says the district court erred in forging an unusual path forward in this litigation. Al-Haramain cannot establish that it suffered injury in fact, a “concrete and particularized” injury, because the Sealed Document is protected by the state secrets privilege. It is not sufficient to speculate that it might be subject to surveillance under the TSP simply because it has been designated a ‘Specially Designated Global Terrorist'",,
51,51,51,51,51,51,51,51,51,51,case284.txt,"Doe, an eight-year veteran of the Army, enlisted for a one-year term in the California State National Guard and the Army Reserve National Guard of the United States. On July 23, 2004, Doe's unit received orders to active-duty in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom. On January 27, 2005, in response to a medical condition, Doe received new orders retaining him on active duty under 10 U.S.C.§ 12301(d). On January 31, 2005 he received his present assignment to the California Medical Community Based Health Care Organization in Sacramento, California. The President declared a national emergency on September 14, 2001. In the same proclamation, he invoked his power under 10 U.S.C.§ 12305 to activate members of the Army National Guard. On July 23, 2004, Doe's unit was activated during the national emergency. Doe argues that his enlistment extension violates his Fifth Amendment rights. The Supreme Court has recognized that under Article I, Congress has wide latitude in delegating its powers. The President's power to extend enlistments is expressly limited, and therefore, if exercised within these limits, cannot be said to be arbitrary. We conclude that 10 U.S.C.§ 12305 is not an unconstitutional delegation of congressional authority. Doe argues that his involuntary enlistment extension violates 10 U.S.C.§ 12407(a) He argues that the “Try One” moniker was misleading and precluded Doe from receiving requisite notice.

(“BAH”), alleging discrimination, wrongful termination, and retaliation.The parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment.On April 22, 2005, the district court granted summary judgment to BAH on all counts, denying Francis' motion and dismissing her complaint with prejudice. Less than two weeks after receiving the Notice of Probation, Francis left the office without authorization in order to attend to a customer at an off-site location. On December 15, 2003, BAH terminated Francis' employment, and this action followed. Francis brings three claims under USERRA, which we will examine in turn. Section 4312 states that “any person whose absence from a position of employment is necessitated by reason of service in the uniformed services shall be entitled to the reemployment rights and benefits of [USERRA].” Francis argues that § 4312 protects her from discrimination with respect to the terms and conditions of employment after she has been rehired. BAH argues that the “reemployment” rights protected by Sections 4312 and 4313 apply only at the instant of reemployment. Francis contends that, after being reemployed as a Level II Senior Consultant, she was gradually given more Tier I work than she had pre-deployment and was no longer given any Tier III work. The district court responded to this argument, noting that Francis offers no support, beyond her own conclusory opinions, for the contention that her status and duties were changed. Francis argues that the district court erred in granting summary judgment to BAH on her claim of improper discharge. She contends that she presented evidence sufficient to create a dispute over whether BAH discharged her in violation of § 4316(c) The district court did not err in deciding this claim on summary judgment.",,
53,53,53,53,53,53,53,53,53,53,case1.txt,"The Stolen Valor Act makes it a crime to falsely claim receipt of military decorations or medals and provides an enhanced penalty if the Congressional Medal of Honor is involved.Respondent pleaded guilty to a charge of falsely claiming that he had received the Medal of honor, but reserved his right to appeal his claim that the Act is unconstitutional. Justice Breyer, joined by Justice Kagan, concluded that because the Stolen Valor Act, as presently drafted, works disproportionate constitutional harm, it fails intermediate scrutiny, and thus violates the First Amendment. Kennedy, J., announced the judgment of the Court and delivered an opinion, in which Roberts, C.J., and Ginsburg and Sotomayor, JJ., joined. Xavier Alvarez lied when he said that he played hockey for the Detroit Red Wings and that he once married a starlet from Mexico. When he lied in announcing he held the Con-gressional Medal of Honor, respondent ventured onto new ground. That lie violates a federal criminal statute, the Stolen Valor Act of 2005. The First Amendment means that government has no power to restrict expression because of its message, its ideas, its subject matter, or its content. As a result, the Constitution ""demands that content-based restrictions on speech be presumed invalid.. and that the Government bear the burden of showing their constitutionality"" The Government's arguments cannot suffice to save the statute. The Court has never endorsed the categorical rule the Government advances: that false statements receive no First Amendment protection. The requirements of a knowing falsehood or reckless disregard for the truth as the condition for recovery in certain defamation cases exists to allow more speech, not less. A rule designed to tolerate certain speech ought not blossom to become a rationale for a rule restricting it. Some false speech may be prohibited even if analogous true speech could not be. The Government has not demonstrated that false statements generally should constitute a new category of unprotected speech on this basis. The probable, and adverse, effect of the Act on freedom of expression illustrates, in a fundamental way, the reasons for the Law's distrust of content-based speech prohibitions. The Government's interest in protecting the integrity of the Medal of Honor is beyond question. The First Amendment requires that the Government's chosen restriction on the speech at issue be ""actually necessary"" to achieve its interest. The Government points to no evidence to support its claim that the public's general perception of military awards is diluted by false claims. The First Amendment itself ensures the right to respond to speech we do not like, and for good reason. Government must demonstrate that unchallenged claims undermine the public's perception of the military and the integrity of its awards system. Only a weak society needs government protection or intervention before it pursues its resolve to preserve the truth. The Stolen Valor Act infringes upon speech protected by the First Amendment. Justice Breyer, with whom Justice Kagan joins, concurring in the judgment. The Court has had to determine whether the statute works speech-related harm that is out of proportion to its justifications. In this case, the term ""intermediate scrutiny"" describes what I think we should do. False factual statements enjoy little First Amendment protection. Threat of criminal prosecution for making a false statement can inhibit the speaker from making true statements, thereby ""chilling"" a kind of speech that lies at the First Amendment's heart. Court emphasizes mens rea requirements that provide ""breathing room"" for more valuable speech. As written, it applies in family, social, or other private contexts, where lies will often cause little harm. It also applies in political contexts where although such lies are more likely to cause harm, the risk of censorious selectivity by prosecutors is also high. Some potential First Amendment threats can be alleviated by interpreting the statute to require knowledge of falsity, etc. The Court strikes down the Stolen Valor Act of 2005, which was enacted to stem an epidemic of false claims about military decorations. Justice Alito, with whom Justice Scalia and Jus- tice Thomas join, dissenting. Only the bravest of the brave are awarded the Congressional Medal of Honor. Every American has a constitutional right to claim to have received this singular award. Justice Breyer argues that Congress could have preserved the integrity of military honors by means other than a criminal prohibition. The plurality recommends a law that would apply only to lies that are intended to ""secure moneys or other valuable considerations"" The chief alternative that is recommended is the compilation and release of a comprehensive list or database of actual medal recipients. The right to freedom of speech has been held to permit recovery for the intentional infliction of emotional distress by means of a false statement. 18 U.S.C. §1001 makes it a crime to ""knowingly and willfully"" make any ""materially false, fictitious, or fraudulent statement or representation"" Justices: False statements of fact do not merit First Amendment protection for their own sake. But it is sometimes necessary to ""exten[d] a measure of strategic protection"" to these statements, they say. Justices: Stolen Valor Act presents no risk that valuable speech will be suppressed. The plurality fears that we will see laws making it a crime to lie about civilian awards such as college degrees or certificates of achievement in the arts and sports. The safeguard against such laws is democracy, not the First Amendment. The Stolen Valor Act is a narrow law enacted to address an important problem. It presents no threat to freedom of expression.",,
54,54,54,54,54,54,54,54,54,54,case375.txt,"Appellants, current and former Navy chaplains of “non-liturgical Protestant” faiths and their endorsing agency, brought suit alleging the Navy has unconstitutionally established and maintained a religious quota system. In the midst of discovery, Appellants moved for preliminary and structural injunctions and for partial summary judgment. The district court denied the motion in its entirety. In both actions, Appellants alleged “the Navy has established, promoted, and maintained religious quotas and other discriminatory practices in the Navy Chaplain Corps in violation of the First and Fifth Amendments.” In re England, 375 F.3d at 1169, cert.denied, 543 U.S. 1152, 125 S.Ct.1343, 161 L.Ed.2d 116 (2005) (Mem.Op.for Prelim.and Structural Inj.;   Den.the Pls.'Mot.for Partial Summ.J.Without Prejudice 2 n.2 (Feb. 7, 2005) ( Mem.Op Appellants contended the age 60 ceiling established by 10 U.S.C.§ 14509 prohibits the Navy from allowing the identified reserve lieutenant and lieutenant commander chaplains over age 62 to remain on active duty. Appellants also identified seven of these FOS Catholic chaplain as age 67 or greater. A preliminary injunction is an extraordinary remedy that should be granted only when the party seeking the relief, by a clear showing, carries the burden of persuasion. To warrant preliminary injunctive relief, the moving party must show a substantial likelihood of success on the merits, that it would suffer irreparable injury if the injunction were not granted, that an injunction would not substantially injure other interested parties, and that the public interest would be furthered by the injunction. The Navy's purported practice reduces Appellants' opportunities for promotion. Such an injury is far too speculative to warrant preliminary injunctive relief. The Navy is authorized to convene special selection boards to review a previous non-promotion. Former officers are entitled to revision of their military record “to correct an error or remove an injustice resulting from not being selected for promotion” by the initial board. Elrod involved political speech and freedom of expression. Republican patronage employees of a county sheriff's department brought suit against, among others, a newly elected county sheriff who was a Democrat. At the time, it was common for an incoming sheriff of a different political party to replace non-civil-service employees with members of his own party. In National Treasury Employees Union v. United States, 927 F.2d 1253 (D.C.Cir.1991), we refused to find irreparable harm where federal employees sought a preliminary injunction after alleging that ethics laws violated their First Amendment rights. Appellees correctly note that this court has construed Elrod to require movants to do more than merely allege a violation of freedom of expression in order to satisfy the irreparable injury prong of the preliminary injunction frame-work. The Elrod plurality noted that the plaintiffs' “First Amendment interests were either threatened or in fact being impaired at the time” They sought preliminary injunctive relief, and that because their injury was “both threatened and occurring” and they showed a probability of success on the merits, a preliminary injunction could follow. The district court here confined its analysis to determining whethethe. The case was decided in 40.517, 84 L.Ed.774 (1940), and the decision was decided by a majority of the jury. The decision was made on the basis of the facts as presented.",,

When he was about to deploy to Iraq in January 2003, he applied for conscientious objection status. The Marine Corps denied his request because he made his request immediately after learning of his imminent departure to Iraq and he never expressed any anti-war religious sentiment. The government has to prove there was a “basis in fact” for its denial of Alhassan's application. The reviewing court does not weigh the evidence for itself or ask whether there is substantial evidence to support the military officials' denial of the applicant's request. A conscientious objector has no constitutional or statutory right to be discharged from active service. On July 22, 2002, Alhassan enlisted for eight years in the Marine Corps Reserve.On January 23, 2003, less than a year later, Al hassan applied for conscientious objector status after receiving orders which would have placed his unit directly in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom. The court concluded that the timing of the plaintiff's conscientious objection application did not suffice as a basis in fact. Alhassan volunteered, of his own free will, to serve in the Marine Corps. In Joyce and Lemmens, the men had no choice as to whether they would volunteer or not-they were drafted.

56,56,56,56,56,56,56,56,56,56,case137.txt,"Appellee Garrett was hired by Circuit City in 1994, while he was a member of the Marine Reserves. In March 2003, Garrett was fired, an action he attributes solely to his status as a Marine Reserve Officer. Garrett sued under USERRA, and the district court agreed with his contention that the law overrides the enforcement of the arbitration agreement. The Supreme Court has reinforced the strong federal policy favoring arbitration. In so holding, the Court clarified several issues concerning the FAA's application. “It is by now clear that statutory claims may be the subject of an arbitration agreement, enforceable pursuant to FAA,” id.at 26, 111 S.Ct.at 1652. The Court also distinguished between an employer/employee agreement enforceable. pursuant to the FAA and union collective bargaining agreements. It is not evident from the statutory language that Congress intended to preclude arbitration by simply granting the possibility of a federal judicial forum. An agreement to arbitrate under the FAA is effectively a forum selection clause. An exclusive judicial forum is not a right protected by Chapter 43 of USERRA, nor is it within the scope of Section 4302(b) In Gilmer, the Court phrased the relevant inquiry as whether Congress had precluded “arbitration or other nonjudicial resolution” of claims. A portion of the 1994 legislative history of USERRA confirms Congressional intent to forbid resort to binding arbitration. We disagree that this snippet of legislative history should affect our interpretation. There is no recognition in the report of Gilmer's then-recent endorsement of individual agreements to arbitrate. Congress did not intend the Secretary of Labor or the Attorney General to be involved in every dispute brought under USERRA. The Arbitration Rules in this case provide a fair opportunity for Garrett to present and prevail upon a claim. The court below erred in refusing to compel arbitration of Garrett's USERRA dispute with Circuit City. The judgment is REVERSED and REMANDED for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.Enforcement of employment arbitration agreements does not disserve or impair the protections guaranteed byUSERRA.",,
57,57,57,57,57,57,57,57,57,57,case138.txt,"Daniel J. Regan was a Missouri National Guardsman who had been on active military duty with the Army for more than a year.On April 16, 2005, Regan met his friend, John Vandergriff, at the Army's Toledo Bend Morale, Welfare, and Recreation (MWR) facility.Both Regan and Vandergriffs were active duty Army staff sergeants assigned to Fort Polk who were off duty for the day.Earlier that morning, VanderGriff had rented a pontoon boat from the MWR facility.The group spent a day relaxing, swimming, and drinking.At approximately 7:00 p.m. that day, the boat was in the waters Starcraft timely appealed from the district court's judgment. Whether the dismissal order is a proper subject of appeal is our first legal issue. The second question is whether that order is either final and appealable under 28 U.S.C.§ 1291, or subject to appeal because of some doctrinal exception to finality.  Starcraft sued the U.S. Army for $1.5 million. The Army dismissed Starcraft's claims against the Army and remanded the remainder of the suit to state court. The dismissal was appealed, and the Supreme Court ruled in favor of the Army. The case was decided on the collateral order doctrine, which allows courts to entertain appeals of certain decisions. Starcraft's third-party claims against the United States were dismissed because of the Feres doctrine. The doctrine has been much-criticized. The Supreme Court found that in suits based on “an injury sustained by a soldier while on duty, the effect of the action upon military discipline is identical whether the suit is brought by the soldier directly or by a third- party.” The Court held that the “scope, nature, legal incidents and consequences of the relation between persons in [military] service and the Government are fundamentally derived from federal sources and governed by federal authority” The Court contrasted the centrality of federal law to military issues with the FTCA's requirement that the law of the state in which injury occurred governs liability. The existence of these generous statutory disability and death benefits is an independent reason why the Feres doctrine bars suit for service-related injuries. In 1985, the Court found the third rationale critical in making a case-by-case analysis. The location of the incident was not nearly as important in deciding whether Feres should apply as was “whether the suit requires the civilian court to second-guess military decisions, and whether the suit might impair essential military discipline”  Shearer, 473 U.S. at 57, 105 S.Ct.3039. The injury to Staff Sergeant Regan occurred when he was off duty, off base, and not engaged in any activity with a direct military purpose. Nothing in the record indicates any soldier on the boat was disciplined by the Army, and even if that occurred, we discern no disruption of that process by this suit. We conclude that this is a situation in which the traditional concerns underlying the third rationale for the Feres bar are absent. Staff Sergeant Regan was on orders calling him to active duty beginning on November 13, 2003, and was scheduled to be released from active duty about a month after this accident. Regan indicated that he did not need to take leave or apparently even receive a pass to pick up his girlfriend at the Shreveport, Louisiana, airport, and proceed to Toledo Bend where the accident occurred. Staff Sergeant Regan was engaged in purely recreational activity.Regardless of the precise location, there was much less military control there than is exerted at Fort Polk. Regan's presence on the boat was due to his relation with Vandergriff, the renter of the boat. In Kelly the Panama Canal Commission, not the military, was the allegedly negligent actor for allowing power lines to hang too low over a place in which sailboats were allowed. In the relevant precedent, a Coast Guardsman's claims were based upon the alleged negligence of a Federal Aviation Administration air traffic controller. Staff Sergeant Regan was on a boat rented from a military-owned, though civilian-run facility. The renter of the boat, Staff Sergeant Vandergriff, had a few hours before Regan's arrival agreed to the rules of the rental. Regan also would have been subject to those rules as a soldier using the facility. At least two precedents prohibited suits brought as a result of incidents involving U.S. Air Force Aero Clubs. Clubs operate on some Air Force bases, are non-appropriated fund instrumentalities of the United States, and promote morale among active-duty personnel who are eligible for “active membership” in the clubs. We conclude that our decision in Kelly v. Panama Canal Commission, which did not apply the Feres bar, to be a valid, nuanced consideration of the issues that arise in off-post, off-duty recreation. In Kelly, it was not significant that the service member was subject to military discipline, as are all those on active military duty. In our case, the boat rental agreement given Staff Sergeant Vandergriff had a minimal checklist of requirements; the boats were allowed to leave the cove owned by the military. The rules discussed apply to Marines, Coast Guardsmen, sailors with the Navy, airmen with the Air Force, and, as was Staff Sergeant Regan, soldiers in the Army. “Furlough” was the proper term for authorized absences from duty of American enlisted soldiers.",,

Eight servicemen were killed and fourteen were severely injured. Plaintiffs filed an action against the contractors that designed and manufactured the allegedly defective aircraft. Boeing removed the action to federal court pursuant to the Federal Officer Removal Statute. Rule 4(k)(2) was narrowly tailored so as to avoid conflict with the Fourteenth Amendment's jurisdictional limits in cases alleging only state-law claims. This narrow extension of the federal reach applies only if a claim is made against the defendant under federal law. Plaintiffs argue that the necessary specifications are lacking with respect to the following design features of the MH–47E Chinook: (i) the engine's ignition system, (ii) the FADECDECU, and (iii) the aircraft itself. According to Plaintiffs, the ignition system was manufactured without a continuous relight function, which would have allowed the engine to restart automatically in the event of a fire. According to the undisputed record, Goodrich provided Army personnel with lengthy and detailed design specifications describing both the FADEC (the control system as a whole) and the DECU (the FadEC's onboard computer) The Army carefully reviewed these specifications, scrutinized their content, and evaluated the reported test results before approving Goodrich's specifications. Boeing argues that the helicopter as a whole was defective. The government invested years in reviewing, developing, and testing both the MH–47E and its engine. Plaintiffs do not present any evidence of a latent manufacturing defect that was undiscovered at the time of acceptance. Plaintiffs argue that the I/O data might have provided evidence of an “electrical anomaly,” but the notion that the measurements would have identified a deviation from the approved design specifications is speculative and thus insufficient to defeat summary judgment.

62,62,62,62,62,62,62,62,62,62,case13.txt,"Appellant Ruth Rosario brought this suit against the Department of the Army and several individuals. She alleged that a two-year campaign of sexual harassment by her co-worker at an Army medical clinic subjected her to a hostile work environment in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act. The district court concluded that the alleged conduct amounted only to a lack of courtesy and professionalism rather than gender-based harassment. The court held that the record showed “Mr.Arroyo [to be] a rude man that lacked courtesy and professionalism,” but that the evidence was inadequate to prove a violation of Title VII. The court concluded that Rosario “failed to prove that she was subjected to conduct sufficiently severe or abusive so as to constitute hostile work environment based on sex” The court granted summary judgment for defendants. Hernández said he explained to Arroyo that “that's what it looks like. That it's so personal that you're just having a frustration about that woman.” Rosario presented evidence of longstanding harassment that interfered with her work on a daily basis and ultimately caused harm to her emotional stability and health. This formal counseling appears to have consisted of Arroyo's completing a “Developmental Counseling Form,” an official document issued by the U.S. Army Training and Doctrine Command, and Rosario's written response. The form, dated November 6, 2002, explains the purpose of the counseling as follows:To develop a clear understanding on appropriate dress code in the work place. ",,

97,97,97,97,97,97,97,97,97,97,case671.txt,"El-Shifa Pharmaceutical Industries Company and Salah El Din Ahmed Mohammed Idris (“Idris”) brought this suit seeking just compensation for the destruction of a manufacturing facility by the armed forces of the United States. The Court of Federal Claims concluded that the government's conduct did not rise to the level of a taking under the Fifth Amendment and dismissed the complaint accordingly. The complaint contained a series of factual allegations denying assertions President Clinton and members of his administration made regarding the Plant's involvement in the production of chemical weapons. The Court of Federal Claims rejected the three original grounds for dismissal, but nevertheless ruled in the government's favor on the ground that the Takings Clause did not apply to the facts alleged in the complaint. The court concluded that it could “not look behind the President's discharge of his Constitutional duties as Commander in Chief, including his declaration of what constitutes an enemy target” The government relies on the Supreme Court's decision in United States v. Verdugo-Urquidez, 494 U.S. 259, 274-75, 110 S.Ct.1056, 108 L.Ed.2d 222 (1990), where the Court held that the Fourth Amendment did not apply to the warrantless search of a Mexican citizen's home in Mexico in connection with a criminal investigation. The parties disagree, however, over the legal implication of the particular facts of the instant case. Claims that the United States may have acted tortiously towards the appellants does not remove it from the jurisdiction of the Court of Federal Claims. If the government appropriates property without paying just compensation, a plaintiff may sue in the Court. A takings claim lies, as long as the government's action was authorized, even if the. action was subject to legal challenge. The Court of Federal Claims was correct to require a greater showing from the government in order to defeat the appellants' prima facie showing of reciprocity. As blanket provisions that apply to “all people,” the legal consequences of their repeal would apparently apply equally to Sudanese and American citizens. Perrin was the first case in which the outlines of an enemy property doctrine applicable to takings jurisprudence can be recognized.The facts of Perrin concerned the destruction of private property that resulted from the razing of the city of Greytown, Nicaragua, on July 13, 1854. United States v. Pacific Railroad Co., 120 U.S. 227, 228-31, 7 S.Ct.490, 30 L.Ed.634 (1887), concerned the destruction of a number of bridges by Union forces operating in Missouri during the Civil War.The claimant, Pacific Railroad Company, provided certain transportation services to the government during the war for a fee that had remained unpaid since the cessation of hostilities. Union forces determined they could impede the advance of the Confederate Army through the area if they destroyed several of the railroad's bridges. In Pacific Railroad, the Court relied on the enemy property doctrine to conclude that the railroad could not hold the government liable in takings for the destruction of any of its bridges. In the Court's view, a state of war unquestionably existed in Missouri at the time Union forces destroyed the railroad's bridges. The Army carried out the destruction of the property as the Japanese were entering the city, thereby depriving them of a “valuable logistic weapon.” The companies relied on two Civil War era cases to support their argument that the government ought to pay them just compensation as a consequence. The property at issue in Caltex was enemy property subject to destruction by the government under the doctrine set forth in Pacific Railroad. As the Court explained, this property, due to the fortunes of war, had become a potential weapon of great significance to the invader. It was destroyed that the United States might better and sooner destroy the enemy. The Constitution grants to the President the “executive Power,” see U.S. Const.art.II, § 1, cl.1. The President is “Commander in Chief of the Army and Navy of the United States, and of the Militia of the several States, when called into actual Service.”   Appellants' Opening Br.at 36-39. The President's power to wage war must necessarily include the power to make extraterritorial enemy property designations, the court said. The aim is the same-to “wage war successfully.” The court concluded that the case was controlled by a long line of decisions, which hold that such cases as this one were settled before the court. The appellants' theory of takings liability centers on the alleged inaccuracy of the President's designation of the Plant as enemy property. If the Plant was in fact the property of al-Qaeda, the appellants would have no claim in takings against the United States for its destruction. In 1998, the President determined that the Plant's destruction was a necessary and proper response to “the imminent threat of further terrorist attacks” The Supreme Court has considered what such a state of affairs would mean for the military's ability to wage war. In Seery, the Court of Claims was confronted with a takings claim made by a United States citizen concerning the appropriation by the Army of the claimants' estate in Austria as an officer's club during World War II. The appellants claim that the property of a citizen or an ally of the United States could not be considered enemy property as a matter of law. Justice Jackson indicated that the constitutional calculus might be different if a domestic, rather than extraterritorial, enemy property designation were at issue. The balance, in this case, must necessarily tip in the President's favor. The decision of the Court of Federal Claims to dismiss the complaint because it raises a nonjusticiable political question is affirmed. The Court has in the past relied alternatively on a theory of implied contract to find compensable takings. ",,

Bremby v. Dep't of the Navy, No.DC-0831-97-0806-C-1 (M.S.P.B.Sept. 14, 1999) (initial decision) The full Board denied petitioners' petition for review. The cases were remanded to the administrative law judge for further consideration. Res Judicata is a doctrine that precludes the parties from relitigating issues that were or could have been raised in an action. The doctrine serves to “relieve parties of the cost and vexation of multiple lawsuits, conserve judicial resources, and encourage reliance on adjudication.” In the Bremby and Stearn enforcement petition actions, the Navy failed to timely raise the res judicata defense. In the Bremby and Stearn actions, petitioners attack the validity of 5 C.F.R.§ 831.906(e) They argue that the regulation is contrary to law and violates constitutional guarantees of due process. The Board, rejecting these contentions, found that the 1 year time limit for retroactive LEO coverage may be waived. We find the Board's decision consistent with law. 5 C.F.R.§§ 831.906(e) and (f), which address these issues, are products of notice-and-comment rulemaking. Supreme Court has recently reaffirmed that rulemaking is “significant’” in pointing to Chevron authority. “Frequently, this delay resulted in only stale, secondary evidence such as affidavits from two employees, each ‘remembering’ what the other person’s job duties were 20 years ago being available.”   51 Fed.Reg.45,471 (Dec. 19, 1986).A one-year period of retroactive coverage operated to insure that the evidence submitted would be “current [and] primary” Id.Such a requirement also operates to encourage employees to seek an early determination of LEO status, allowing them to retire at an early age. The Board's determination that petitioners had not shown that 5 C.F.R.§§ 831.906(e) and (f) are invalid, ambiguous, or violative of due process is not arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.

The United States District Court for the District of Puerto Rico dismissed their claims for want of subject matter jurisdiction, holding that the claims were barred by the Federal Tort Claims Act. In May 2000, the Navy discontinued live-fire exercises at the AFWTF.On April 30, 2003, the U.S. terminated all military exercises on Vieques Island.The plaintiffs, residents of Vieques, filed suits against the United States under the FTCA on March 19 and April 27, 2004. The plaintiffs sought damages for physical injury, emotional distress and property damage. In Berkovitz v. United States, 486 U.S. 531, 108 S.Ct.1954, 100 L.Ed.2d 531 (1988), the Court addressed for the first time the question whether failure to comply with such a directive made the discretionary function exception inapplicable. In Gaubert, the Court reaffirmed that the exception did not shield the actions of employees of the Food and Drug Administration who licensed a vaccine in violation of mandatory requirements. In Gaubert, the Court was concerned with the situation “[w]here Congress has delegated the authority to an independent agency ․ to implement the general provisions of a regulatory statute.” In Berkovitz, the actions of Food and Drug Administration and National Institutes of Health regulators were also cited. The issue in those cases concerned the exercise of discretion by the regulators. Plaintiffs first rely on alleged violations of the Clean Water Act (“CWA”), 33 U.S.C.§ 1251-1387 (2000) They argue that the Navy violated a mandatory RCRA requirement by operating the burning/open burning facility at the AFWTF without a valid RCRA permit. The FTCA would become a medium for enforcing the entire regulatory scheme.  RCRA regulates “hazardous waste treatment, storage and disposal facilities” (“TSDFs”) A RCRA permit from the EPA is required in order to lawfully operate a TSDF. The parties agree that the Navy timely initiated the first step in the permit application process, and in so doing obtained “interim” permit status that allowed the Navy to operate the facility. Meghrig v. KFC Western, Inc., 516 U.S. 479, 484-85, 116 S.Ct.1251, 134 L.Ed.2d 121 (1996) Court noted that RCRA's “elaborate [enforcement] scheme” is directed solely toward correcting existing or future harms by restraining them. The plaintiffs argue that section 4 of the NCA requires the Navy to comply with the Puerto Rico Noise Prohibition Act. Section 4 of NCA provides, in pertinent part, that each department, agency, or instrumentality of the executive, legislative, and judicial branches of the federal government must comply with such requirements.

The district court agreed with genon and dismissed the case. On appeal, we are faced with a matter of first impression whether the clean. air act preempts state law tort claims brought by private property owners against a source of pollution. located within the state. genon subchapter v permit for cheswick imposes limits on the emission of various particulate matter,gasses,chemical,and compounds from coal combustion. Class seeks to recover compensatory and punitive damages under three state common law tort theories nuisance negligence and recklessness and trespass. Genon moved to dismiss the action on the grounds that the state law tort claims were preempted by the clean air act. The supreme court has interpreted the supremacy clause as preempting any state law that interferes with or is contrary to federal law. The court found that the savings clause of the clean air act does not alter this analysis. The class now appeals this decision. The clean water act contains two savings clauses,one located in the citizen suit provision,and another which focuses on states rights. ",,

The trial court suspended defendant sentence and placed him on months probation,conditional upon defendant serving days in county jail. A pile of trash, including containers of paint and chemicals,dumped in the road,blocking part of a lane. The debris included and latex paints,resin hardener,carpet cement, two containers of waste oil,rust primer,pipe cement,and lock tight cement. Some of the containers were unlabeled and some had warning labels. Defendant contends there was insufficient evidence to support his conviction for unlawful transport of hazardous waste,subd.c count. In assessing the sufficiency of the evidence, we review the entire record in the light most favorable to the judgment to determine whether it discloses evidence that is reasonable,credible,and of solid value. The courts interpret the term reparation to mean reimbursement to the victims of crime for actual loss flowing from the charged offense or from related misconduct. The government may be the beneficiary of that reimbursement if it has incurred actual loss due to the crime, as in the instance of tax evasion or theft of government property. Reparation does not include the general costs of prosecuting and rehabilitating criminals. ",,

363,363,363,363,363,363,363,363,363,363,case1699.txt,"parker shattuck petitioned for a writ of mandate,maintaining that an eir was required because contamination on the site poses health risks to the project construction workers and future residents. We affirm the trial court denial of the writ because parkerShattuck has failed to identify substantial evidence supporting a fair argument that there may be a significant effect on the environment. parker shattuck filed this lawsuit in february,seeking a writ of mandate to compel the city to set aside approval of the mnd and project and to prepare an eir. The city council approved the project in january,the trial court issued a tentative order denying the petition,and a hearing occurred over two days in july. The court then issued an order and proposed statement of decision denied the petition and entered judgment. parker shattuck contends that the city is required to prepare an eir because the mnd contains inadequate measures to mitigate environmental effects that will be caused by excavating and disturbing toxic soil. It argues that the project will have a significant effect on the environment by threatening the health of construction workers and future residents. city of chula vista th,creed argues that disturbing contaminated soil can be a physical change in the environment. yosemite community college dist.th,ace project to remove a shooting range that would not increase the lead contamination already present due to bullets might nevertheless spread that contamination. City argues that this case is not about the project affecting the environment, but is instead about the environment at the site. parker shattuck argues that soil contamination at a project site is sufficient to trigger an eir. We agree that the legislature intended that projects on these sites should not be categorically exempt from ceqa because they may be more likely to involve significant effects on the environment. We conclude that the health risks to workers and residents identified by petitioners do not constitute substantial adverse effects on human beings. ",,

The medicine wheel is a prehistoric stone circle about feet in diameter that was constructed by the aboriginal peoples of north america. The wheel includes a large cairn in the center and radiating spokes of rocks. The service had, in september,advertised for bidding on a timber sale in an area referred to as horse creek. The service canceled the sale after receiving bids but before opening the bids,citing a procedural error in having failed to consult formally with the parties to the hpp. The judge held that plaintiff lacked standing as to the first amendment claims. We discern no allegation of cognizable injury separate from the alleged loss of opportunity for profitable logging. We think that the district judge can not be faulted for his holding that the plaintiff attempt to establish standing faltered at the third requirement rather than the first. We held that the loss of the possibility of obtaining a federal lease for coal mining was an injury not redressable by a favorable decision. ",,

Section a of the settlement act requires the secretary of the interior to acquire sufficient water and water rights from willing sellers to sustain approximately acres of primary wetland habitat. The pyramid lake indian reservation includes pyramid lake,the land surrounding it,the lower reaches of the truckee river,and the bottom land alongside the lower truc Kee. The project was designed to irrigate a substantial area in the vicinity of fallon,nevada,with waters from both thetruckee and the carson rivers. The alpine decree quantified individual water rights, established the rights to reservoir storage in the upper carson river watershed, and provided a starting point for an interstate allocation. After years of litigation,the district court entered a final decree in.united states alpine land reservoir,aff,cir,cert denied,d. The truckee is the principal source of water for irrigation,municipal,industrial and domestic uses in the metropolitan area and provides water to the newlands reclamation project. The settlement act directed several actions involving water allocation and usage in the region. Section a directs the secretary of the interior to negotiate with california and nevada to reach an agreement governing operation of the reservoirs. Review under the rule of reason and for abuse of discretion are essentially the same. We are not free to impose upon the agency our own notion of which procedures are best or most likely to further some vague,undefined public good. We must,however,strictly interpret the procedural requirements in nepa and the ceq regulations to the fullest extent possible. Title c is one of the provisions intended as a directive to all agencies to assure consideration of the environmental impact of their actions in decisionmaking.compliance with this requirement ensures that the agency will have available,and will carefully consider,detailed information concerning significant environmental impacts. The service concluded that acquisition of water rights from newlands project owners is the most readily available source of water for wetlands maintenance. In kleppe,several environmental organizations sued the department of the interior for failing to prepare a programmatic eis on coal actions such as issuing coal leases,approving mining plans,and otherwise enabling private companies and public utilities to develop coal reserves. The court found that plaintiffs desire for a regional environmental impact statement could not be met for practical reasons. Nepa does not require an eis to supply an justification for a project. A programmatic eis should be prepared if it can be and if its absence will obstruct environmental review. A cumulative environmental impact results from the incremental impact of the action when added to other past, present,and reasonably foreseeable future actions. The act concerns the apportionment and use of water from the truckee and carson rivers. The fish and wildlife service,the bureau of indian affairs,and the bureau of reclamation had built up considerable expertise regarding the law,the water resource situation in the area. Plaintiffs argue that the service failed to analyze the cumulative impacts of section acquisitions together with all the other reasonably foreseeable settlement act actions affecting allocations for the newlands reclamation project and the wetlands. Plaintiffs contend that the lengthy list of impacts provided by the service can not substitute for the required analysis. ",,

The courts have referred to this crime as a trespass. We conclude the placing of a sign, setting forth entrance requirements some distance from a public highway on the Fort Lee access road does not provide notice of the requirements to enter the military installation. Madrigal contends that the evidence was insufficient to demonstrate that he received notice of the entry requirements before he entered the Fort Lee military installation. The district court sentenced Madrigal to time served and ordered that upon his release from custody, he should be turned over to the United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement for removal to Mexico. The Ninth Circuit affirmed the conviction of peace demonstrators who entered a military base without permission of the base commander. In United States v. Hall, 742 F.2d 1153, 1154 (9th Cir.1984), the Ninth Circuit said the defendants were warned by the sign, the five security guards, and the fence around the installation. Accordingly, contrary to district court's alternative holding, Madrigal's entry into the Fort Lee access road was not conduct that was prohibited by §’1325(a) or §‘1382.Because the evidence is insufficient to demonstrate that MadrigAl had notice of the requirements for entry before he drove onto the FortLee access road, we hold that the judgment must be reversed.

Unocal contends that the claims are barred by the statute of limitations that the punitive damages award must be reversed and that interest on the judgment was incorrectly calculated. unocal asserts that its federal due process rights were violated by the admission of evidence of unocal dissimilar conduct relating to other spills. unocal guaranteed a loan on the property,the proceeds of which were used by plaintiffs garry holdgrafer ii,cindy okerson,and holdgraFER okerson to buy out miller and maloney interests in the property. Three industrial buildings had been built on the two front parcels of the property and were fully rented to various tenants. soil tests that revealed oil contamination. unocal is committed to working with its neighbors along tank farm road to ensure that they do not suffer damages as a result of the contamination. Unocal reimbursed plaintiffs for fees incurred in seeking financing, including the increase in interest payments that plaintiffs incurred in obtaining a extension of the loan.unocal has continued to make monthly payments to unocal at the lesser interest rate. The court tentatively ruled it would allow evidence regarding the actions by unocal with respect to reporting,maintaining,installation sic,leakage and concealment of leakage from pipelines. The court also ruled,however, that plaintiffs shall make an offer of proof outside the presence of the jury if they intend to present any such evidence. The jury found by clear and convincing evidence that unocal was guilty of malice,fraud or oppression on the nuisance and negligence claims, and awarded plaintiffs in punitive damages. unocal moved for a new trial and for judgment notwithstanding the verdict, contending that plaintiffs claims were barred by the statute of limitations. The court rejected both of these claims. The jury found that unocal induced plaintiffs to believe that they need not file a lawsuit in order to receive an amicable settlement of their claims against unocal. The jury also found that plaintiffs reasonable reliance on unocal representations began on february,date of unocal response to holdgrafer demand ended in feb February. The jury heard that unocal had concealed other spills and leaks from the public and government,and had also denied responsibility for contamination and misrepresented the magnitude of damage to the environment. The court must exclude evidence regarding conduct that had nothing to do with the plaintiff claim,at.this rule is mirrored in the evidence code. Plaintiffs failed to establish any nexus between unocal intentional or negligent concealment of the numerous leaks at the guadalupe facility. No evidence that unocal failed to disclose any reports it actually had regarding a and b line leaks, or that it failed to report any such leaks to the government. Unocal would not excavate the contamination unless ordered to do so. ",,

The trial court denied the petition,agreeing with the city that the project is categoricallyexempt from ceqa under guidelines section,subdivision c. ceqa applies if the activity is a project under the statutory definition,unless the project is exempt. The issues on appeal concern the second tier of the ceqa analysis, whether the city erred in finding that the car wash project is categorically exempt from ceqa. There are no unusual circumstances creating a reasonable possibility the activity will have a significant effect on the environment. The dispute centers on whether a car wash generally fits within the definition of commercial buildings in guidelines section,subdivision c, and whether the car wash at issue here,at square feet, is within that section size restrictions. The city of berkeley says the exemption applies only to commercial buildings that do not involv e the use of significant amounts of hazardous substances. A party challenging the exemption,must show that the project will have a significant environmental impact. The court explained that challengers to the project had to show some feature that distinguishes it from any other small,commercial building or use. The hearing was held at the San Francisco County Courthouse. Appellants claimed there is a fair argument that the car wash and coffee shop may have significant adverse noise and traffic effects in the area. The evidence they rely upon and their arguments fall well short of establishing that the project will have a significant environmental effect on the area, the court said. ",,

1137,1137,1137,1137,1137,1137,1137,1137,1137,1137,case1135.txt,"It appears the chief financial officer of a company embezzled million by directing four fraudulent funds transfers from the company account to an account he controlled. He has disappeared with the money. The ultimate question in this litigation is who must bear the loss the bank that honored the fraudulent payment orders or the company that employed theEmbezzler. zengen had concluded that yen had stolen money from the company by ordering the wire transfers from the account to the chinatrust bank. yen had disappeared with the company financial records and could not be located. He also testified that he also spoke with julie yen at a restaurant in monterey park. zengen alleges that the bank did not follow the security procedure that was in place because it did not obtain verbal authorization from liu,as the funds transfer authorization agreement required. Because the trial court granted summary judgment for the bank on other grounds, this question has not been litigated in this case. We must decide whether the california uniform commercial code displaces the non-california commercial code causes of action. The law revision commission are persuasive of legislative intent when the legislature adopts a law exactly as the commission proposed. The focus of article is a type of payment,commonly referred to as a wholesale wire transfer,which is used almost exclusively between business or financial institutions. The rules that emerged represent a careful and delicate balancing of those interests and are intended to be the exclusive means of determining rights,duties and liabilities. zengen argues that the california code does not cover its negligence cause of action because it alleges a number of circumstances that should have caused the bank to become suspicious and discover the fraud. The court of appeal concluded,the facts of this case fall squarely within the provisions of division of the cal ifornia uniform commercial code. The California uniform commercial code distinguishes between the payment and the payment order. The code requires the customer to notify the bank of the relevant facts within a shorter period than one year or face certain consequences. The section that zengen relies on in seeking a refund provides an example. ",,

The federal reserve act prohibits member banks of the federal reserve system from paying,either directly or indirectly,any interest on any demand deposit. Banks knowingly diverted interest earned on appellants escrow funds to the title companies through the artifices of earning credits and monthly revolving credit facilities mrcf. Earnings credits went to shell companies that had no independent existence,employees or payroll expenses,based on phony invoices. shell companies in turn funneled or rebated the payments to title companies. Appellants seek damages and restitution premised on their legal right to interest allegedly wrongfully paid to the title companies. In order to recover damages based on diverted interest under any of the tort causes of action,appellants must demonstrate a wrongful invasion by the defendant of some legal right of the plaintiff.

We affirm the district court conclusion as to preemption under the bank act but hold that the per diem statute is not preempted by the didmca. The court also entered a permanent injunction against the commissioner,barring him from exercising visitorial powers. Commissioner argues that because operating subsidiaries are not,themselves,national banks,they are therefore not subject to exclusively federal regulation. His argument challenges the propriety of the regulation. The court has approved the incidental powers provision permitting a range of bank authority beyond that specified in the statute. operating subsidiary rule. Permitting operating subsidiaries does not expand the functions carried out by the banks. The decision to conduct banking activities through subsidiaries neither expands the national banks scope of activities nor undermines the authority of the occ to regulate those activities. The court has explained when the administrator of state law promulgates regulations that were intended by the statute, the agency should take care not to disturb the very policies it is trying to regulate. visitorial power under the bank act  wfhmi and the occ submit that the commissioner state law authority to conduct or require audits of national bank operating subsidiaries is displaced. Their argument,with which we agree,is that section of bank act,makes federal visitorial not necessarily federal substantive with regard to national banks. National banks are not directly chartered by the federal government instead, they are incorporated under a state in california ncmc in ohio. This chartering distinction is the one irreducible difference between national banks and their operating subsidiaries. We are convinced,however,by the occ alternative calif California attempt to license operating subsidiaries is by the occ own licensing regulations. If a congressional statute includes a provision explicitly preempting state law,the only issue we must decide is its scope. The district court concluded that it does. California per diem statutes limit the time during which interest can be charged by prohibiting a lender from charging interest on loaned mortgage funds. wells fargo has advised this court that wfhmi recently merged back into wells fargo national bank and so no longer exists as an independent entity. California licensing authority over such entities section a of the didmca,however,does not preempt california per diem statutes. ",,
